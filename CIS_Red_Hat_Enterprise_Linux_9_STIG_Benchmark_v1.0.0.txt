Overview
maintain and/or increase the security of the addressed technology, and they should be
used in conjunction with other essential cyber hygiene tasks like:
• Monitoring the base operating system and applications for vulnerabilities and
quickly updating with the latest security patches.
• End-point protection (Antivirus software, Endpoint Detection and Response
(EDR), etc.).
• Logging and monitoring user and system activity.
In the end, the Benchmarks are designed to be a key component of a comprehensive
cybersecurity program.
Important Usage Information
All Benchmarks are available free for non-commercial use from the CIS Website. They
can be used to manually assess and remediate systems and applications. In lieu of
manual assessment and remediation, there are several tools available to assist with
assessment:
• CIS Configuration Assessment Tool (CIS-CAT® Pro Assessor)
These tools make the hardening process much more scalable for large numbers of
systems and applications.
NOTE:
Some tooling focuses only on the Benchmark Recommendations that can
be fully automated (skipping ones marked Manual). It is important that ALL
Recommendations (Automated and Manual) be addressed since all are
important for properly securing systems and are typically in scope for
audits.
Key Stakeholders
Cybersecurity is a collaborative effort, and cross functional cooperation is imperative
within an organization to discuss, test, and deploy Benchmarks in an effective and
efficient way. The Benchmarks are developed to be best practice configuration
guidelines applicable to a wide range of use cases. In some organizations, exceptions
to specific Recommendations will be needed, and this team should work to prioritize the
problematic Recommendations based on several factors like risk, time, cost, and labor.
These exceptions should be properly categorized and documented for auditing
purposes.
Apply the Correct Version of a Benchmark
Benchmarks are developed and tested for a specific set of products and versions and
applying an incorrect Benchmark to a system can cause the resulting pass/fail score to
be incorrect. This is due to the assessment of settings that do not apply to the target
systems. To assure the correct Benchmark is being assessed:
• Deploy the Benchmark applicable to the way settings are managed in the
environment: An example of this is the Microsoft Windows family of
Benchmarks, which have separate Benchmarks for Group Policy, Intune, and
Stand-alone systems based upon how system management is deployed.
Applying the wrong Benchmark in this case will give invalid results.
• Use the most recent version of a Benchmark: This is true for all Benchmarks,
but especially true for cloud technologies. Cloud technologies change frequently
and using an older version of a Benchmark may have invalid methods for
auditing and remediation.
Exceptions
The guidance items in the Benchmarks are called recommendations and not
requirements, and exceptions to some of them are expected and acceptable. The
Benchmarks strive to be a secure baseline, or starting point, for a specific technology,
with known issues identified during Benchmark development are documented in the
Impact section of each Recommendation. In addition, organizational, system specific
requirements, or local site policy may require changes as well, or an exception to a
Recommendation or group of Recommendations (e.g. A Benchmark could Recommend
that a Web server not be installed on the system, but if a system's primary purpose is to
function as a Webserver, there should be a documented exception to this
Recommendation for that specific server).
In the end, exceptions to some Benchmark Recommendations are common and
acceptable, and should be handled as follows:
• The reasons for the exception should be reviewed cross-functionally and be well
documented for audit purposes.
• A plan should be developed for mitigating, or eliminating, the exception in the
future, if applicable.
• If the organization decides to accept the risk of this exception (not work toward
mitigation or elimination), this should be documented for audit purposes.
It is the responsibility of the organization to determine their overall security policy, and
which settings are applicable to their unique needs based on the overall risk profile for
the organization.
Remediation
CIS has developed Build Kits for many technologies to assist in the automation of
hardening systems. Build Kits are designed to correspond to Benchmark's
“Remediation” section, which provides the manual remediation steps necessary to make
that Recommendation compliant to the Benchmark.
When remediating systems (changing configuration settings on
deployed systems as per the Benchmark's Recommendations),
please approach this with caution and test thoroughly.
The following is a reasonable remediation approach to follow:
• CIS Build Kits, or internally developed remediation methods should never be
applied to production systems without proper testing.
• Proper testing consists of the following:
o Understand the configuration (including installed applications) of the targeted
systems. Various parts of the organization may need different configurations
(e.g., software developers vs standard office workers).
o Read the Impact section of the given Recommendation to help determine if
there might be an issue with the targeted systems.
o Test the configuration changes with representative lab system(s). If issues
arise during testing, they can be resolved prior to deploying to any production
systems.
o When testing is complete, initially deploy to a small sub-set of production
systems and monitor closely for issues. If there are issues, they can be
resolved prior to deploying more broadly.
o When the initial deployment above is completes successfully, iteratively
deploy to additional systems and monitor closely for issues. Repeat this
process until the full deployment is complete.
Summary
Using the Benchmarks Certified tools, working as a team with key stakeholders, being
selective with exceptions, and being careful with remediation deployment, it is possible
to harden large numbers of deployed systems in a cost effective, efficient, and safe
manner.

applicable.  If any of the components are not applicable it will be noted, or the
component will not be included in the recommendation.
Title
Concise description for the recommendation's intended configuration.
Assessment Status
An assessment status is included for every recommendation. The assessment status
indicates whether the given recommendation can be automated or requires manual
steps to implement. Both statuses are equally important and are determined and
supported as defined below:
Automated
Represents recommendations for which assessment of a technical control can be fully
automated and validated to a pass/fail state. Recommendations will include the
necessary information to implement automation.
Manual
Represents recommendations for which assessment of a technical control cannot be
fully automated and requires all or some manual steps to validate that the configured
state is set as expected. The expected state can vary depending on the environment.
Profile
A collection of recommendations for securing a technology or a supporting platform.
Most benchmarks include at least a Level 1 and Level 2 Profile. Level 2 extends Level 1
recommendations and is not a standalone profile. The Profile Definitions section in the
benchmark provides the definitions as they pertain to the recommendations included for
the technology.
Description
Detailed information pertaining to the setting with which the recommendation is
concerned. In some cases, the description will include the recommended value.
Rationale Statement
Detailed reasoning for the recommendation to provide the user a clear and concise
understanding on the importance of the recommendation.
Impact Statement
Any security, functionality, or operational consequences that can result from following
the recommendation.
Audit Procedure

recommendation.
Remediation Procedure
Systematic instructions for applying recommendations to the target system to bring it
into compliance according to the recommendation.
Default Value
Default value for the given setting in this recommendation, if known. If not known, either
not configured or not defined will be applied.
References
Additional documentation relative to the recommendation.
CIS Critical Security Controls® (CIS Controls®)
The mapping between a recommendation and the CIS Controls is organized by CIS
Controls version, Safeguard, and Implementation Group (IG). The Benchmark in its
entirety addresses the CIS Controls safeguards of (v7) “5.1 - Establish Secure
Configurations” and (v8) '4.1 - Establish and Maintain a Secure Configuration Process”
so individual recommendations will not be mapped to these safeguards.
Additional Information
Supplementary information that does not correspond to any other field but may be
useful to the user.

CLASSIFICATION unclassified
1.1 RHEL-09-171011 (Manual)
Profile Applicability:
•  SEVERITY: CAT II
Description:
RHEL 9 must display the Standard Mandatory DOD Notice and Consent Banner before
granting local or remote access to the system via a graphical user logon.
GROUP ID: V-270174
RULE ID: SV-270174r1044831
Rationale:
Display of a standardized and approved use notification before granting access to the
operating system ensures privacy and security notification verbiage used is consistent
with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations,
standards, and guidance.
System use notifications are required only for access via logon interfaces with human
users and are not required when such human interfaces do not exist.
The banner must be formatted in accordance with applicable DOD policy. Use the
following verbiage for operating systems that can accommodate banners of 1300
characters:
"You are accessing a U.S. Government (USG) Information System (IS) that is provided
for USG-authorized use only.
By using this IS (which includes any device attached to this IS), you consent to the
following conditions:
-The USG routinely intercepts and monitors communications on this IS for purposes
including, but not limited to, penetration testing, COMSEC monitoring, network
operations and defense, personnel misconduct (PM), law enforcement (LE), and
counterintelligence (CI) investigations.
-At any time, the USG may inspect and seize data stored on this IS.
-Communications using, or data stored on, this IS are not private, are subject to routine
monitoring, interception, and search, and may be disclosed or used for any USG-
authorized purpose.
-This IS includes security measures (e.g., authentication and access controls) to protect
USG interests--not for your personal benefit or privacy.
-Notwithstanding the above, using this IS does not constitute consent to PM, LE or CI
investigative searching or monitoring of the content of privileged communications, or
work product, related to personal representation or services by attorneys,
psychotherapists, or clergy, and their assistants. Such communications and work
product are private and confidential. See User Agreement for details."
Satisfies: SRG-OS-000023-GPOS-00006, SRG-OS-000228-GPOS-00088
Audit:
Note: This requirement assumes the use of the RHEL 9 default graphical user interface,
Gnome Shell. If the system does not have any graphical user interface installed, this
requirement is Not Applicable.
Verify RHEL 9 displays the Standard Mandatory DOD Notice and Consent Banner
before granting access to the operating system via a graphical user logon.
Check that the operating system displays the exact Standard Mandatory DOD Notice
and Consent Banner text with the command:
$ gsettings get org.gnome.login-screen banner-message-text
banner-message-text=
'You are accessing a U.S. Government (USG) Information System (IS) that is

confidential. See User Agreement for details. '
Note: The "\n " characters are for formatting only. They will not be displayed on the
graphical interface.
If the banner does not match the Standard Mandatory DOD Notice and Consent Banner
exactly, this is a finding.
Remediation:
Configure the operating system to display the Standard Mandatory DOD Notice and
Consent Banner before granting access to the system.
Add the following lines to the [org/gnome/login-screen] section of the
"/etc/dconf/db/local.d/01-banner-message":

1.2 RHEL-09-211010 (Manual)
Profile Applicability:
•  SEVERITY: CAT I
Description:
RHEL 9 must be a vendor-supported release.
GROUP ID: V-257777
RULE ID: SV-257777r991589
Rationale:
An operating system release is considered "supported" if the vendor continues to
provide security patches for the product. With an unsupported release, it will not be
possible to resolve security issues discovered in the system software.
Red Hat offers the Extended Update Support (EUS) add-on to a Red Hat Enterprise
Linux subscription, for a fee, for those customers who wish to standardize on a specific
minor release for an extended period.
Audit:
Verify that the version or RHEL 9 is vendor supported with the following command:
$ cat /etc/redhat-release
Red Hat Enterprise Linux release 9.2 (Plow)
If the installed version of RHEL 9 is not supported, this is a finding.
Remediation:
Upgrade to a supported version of RHEL 9.

1.3 RHEL-09-211015 (Manual)
Profile Applicability:
•  SEVERITY: CAT II
Description:
RHEL 9 vendor packaged system security patches and updates must be installed and
up to date.
GROUP ID: V-257778
RULE ID: SV-257778r991589
Rationale:
Installing software updates is a fundamental mitigation against the exploitation of
publicly known vulnerabilities. If the most recent security patches and updates are not
installed, unauthorized users may take advantage of weaknesses in the unpatched
software. The lack of prompt attention to patching could result in a system compromise.
Audit:
Verify RHEL 9 security patches and updates are installed and up to date. Updates are
required to be applied with a frequency determined by organizational policy.
Obtain the list of available package security updates from Red Hat. The URL for
updates is https://access.redhat.com/errata-search/. It is important to note that updates
provided by Red Hat may not be present on the system if the underlying packages are
not installed.
Check that the available package security updates have been installed on the system
with the following command:
$ dnf history list | more
ID | Command line | Date and time | Action(s) | Altered
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
--
70 | install aide | 2023-03-05 10:58 | Install | 1
69 | update -y | 2023-03-04 14:34 | Update | 18 EE
68 | install vlc | 2023-02-21 17:12 | Install | 21
67 | update -y | 2023-02-21 17:04 | Update | 7 EE
Typical update frequency may be overridden by Information Assurance Vulnerability
Alert (IAVA) notifications from CYBERCOM.
If the system is in noncompliance with the organizational patching policy, this is a
finding.
Remediation:
Install RHEL 9 security patches and updates at the organizationally defined frequency.
If system updates are installed via a centralized repository that is configured on the
system, all updates can be installed with the following command:
$ sudo dnf update

1.4 RHEL-09-211020 (Manual)
Profile Applicability:
•  SEVERITY: CAT II
Description:
RHEL 9 must display the Standard Mandatory DOD Notice and Consent Banner before
granting local or remote access to the system via a command line user logon.
GROUP ID: V-257779
RULE ID: SV-257779r958390
Rationale:
Display of a standardized and approved use notification before granting access to the
operating system ensures privacy and security notification verbiage used is consistent
with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations,
standards, and guidance.
System use notifications are required only for access via login interfaces with human
users and are not required when such human interfaces do not exist.
Satisfies: SRG-OS-000023-GPOS-00006, SRG-OS-000228-GPOS-00088
Audit:
Verify RHEL 9 displays the Standard Mandatory DOD Notice and Consent Banner
before granting access to the operating system via a command line user logon.
Check that a banner is displayed at the command line login screen with the following
command:
$ sudo cat /etc/issue
If the banner is set correctly it will return the following text:
"You are accessing a U.S. Government (USG) Information System (IS) that is
provided for USG-authorized use only.
By using this IS (which includes any device attached to this IS), you consent
to the following conditions:
-The USG routinely intercepts and monitors communications on this IS for

communications, or work product, related to personal representation or
services by attorneys, psychotherapists, or clergy, and their assistants.
Such communications and work product are private and confidential. See User
Agreement for details."
If the banner text does not match the Standard Mandatory DOD Notice and
Consent Banner exactly, or the line is commented out, this is a finding.
Remediation:
Configure RHEL 9 to display the Standard Mandatory DOD Notice and Consent Banner
before granting access to the system via command line logon.
Edit the "/etc/issue" file to replace the default text with the Standard Mandatory DOD
Notice and Consent Banner. The DOD-required text is:
"You are accessing a U.S. Government (USG) Information System (IS) that is
provided for USG-authorized use only.

1.5 RHEL-09-211030 (Automated)
Profile Applicability:
•  SEVERITY: CAT II
Description:
The graphical display manager must not be the default target on RHEL 9 unless
approved.
GROUP ID: V-257781
RULE ID: SV-257781r991589
Rationale:
Unnecessary service packages must not be installed to decrease the attack surface of
the system. Graphical display managers have a long history of security vulnerabilities
and must not be used, unless approved and documented.
Audit:
Verify that RHEL 9 is configured to boot to the command line:
$ systemctl get-default
multi-user.target
If the system default target is not set to "multi-user.target" and the information system
security officer (ISSO) lacks a documented requirement for a graphical user interface,
this is a finding.
Remediation:
Document the requirement for a graphical user interface with the ISSO or set the default
target to multi-user with the following command:
$ sudo systemctl set-default multi-user.target

1.6 RHEL-09-211035 (Automated)
Profile Applicability:
•  SEVERITY: CAT III
Description:
RHEL 9 must enable the hardware random number generator entropy gatherer service.
GROUP ID: V-257782
RULE ID: SV-257782r991589
Rationale:
The most important characteristic of a random number generator is its randomness,
namely its ability to deliver random numbers that are impossible to predict. Entropy in
computer security is associated with the unpredictability of a source of randomness.
The random source with high entropy tends to achieve a uniform distribution of random
values. Random number generators are one of the most important building blocks of
cryptosystems.
The rngd service feeds random data from hardware device to kernel random device.
Quality (nonpredictable) random number generation is important for several security
functions (i.e., ciphers).
Audit:
Note: For RHEL 9 systems running with kernel FIPS mode enabled as specified by
RHEL-09-671010, this requirement is Not Applicable.
Verify that RHEL 9 has enabled the hardware random number generator entropy
gatherer service with the following command:
$ systemctl is-active rngd
active
If the "rngd" service is not active, this is a finding.

Description:
RHEL 9 must require a boot loader superuser password.
GROUP ID: V-257787
RULE ID: SV-257787r1044836
Rationale:
To mitigate the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive information by entities that have
been issued certificates by DOD-approved PKIs, all DOD systems (e.g., web servers
and web portals) must be properly configured to incorporate access control methods
that do not rely solely on the possession of a certificate for access. Successful
authentication must not automatically give an entity access to an asset or security
boundary. Authorization procedures and controls must be implemented to ensure each
authenticated entity also has a validated and current authorization. Authorization is the
process of determining whether an entity, once authenticated, is permitted to access a
specific asset. Information systems use access control policies and enforcement
mechanisms to implement this requirement.
Password protection on the boot loader configuration ensures users with physical
access cannot trivially alter important bootloader settings. These include which kernel to
use, and whether to enter single-user mode.
Audit:
Verify the boot loader superuser password has been set with the following command:
$ sudo grep password_pbkdf2 /etc/grub2.cfg
password_pbkdf2  <superusers-accountname>   ${GRUB2_PASSWORD}
To verify the boot loader superuser account password has been set and the password
encrypted, run the following command:
$ sudo cat /boot/grub2/user.cfg
GRUB2_PASSWORD=grub.pbkdf2.sha512.10000.C4E08AC72FBFF7E837FD267BFAD7AEB3D42DD

Profile Applicability:
•  SEVERITY: CAT II
Description:
RHEL 9 must disable virtual system calls.
GROUP ID: V-257792
RULE ID: SV-257792r1044842
Rationale:
System calls are special routines in the Linux kernel, which userspace applications ask
to do privileged tasks. Invoking a system call is an expensive operation because the
processor must interrupt the currently executing task and switch context to kernel mode
and then back to userspace after the system call completes. Virtual system calls map
into user space a page that contains some variables and the implementation of some
system calls. This allows the system calls to be executed in userspace to alleviate the
context switching expense.
Virtual system calls provide an opportunity of attack for a user who has control of the
return instruction pointer. Disabling virtual system calls help to prevent return oriented
programming (ROP) attacks via buffer overflows and overruns. If the system intends to
run containers based on RHEL 6 components, then virtual system calls will need
enabled so the components function properly.

Audit:
Verify the current GRUB 2 configuration disables virtual system calls with the following
command:
$ sudo grubby --info=ALL | grep args | grep -v 'vsyscall=none'

Check that virtual system calls are disabled by default to persist in kernel updates with
the following command:
$ sudo grep vsyscall /etc/default/grub
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="vsyscall=none"
If "vsyscall" is not set to "none", is missing or commented out, and is not documented

Description:
RHEL 9 must clear memory when it is freed to prevent use-after-free attacks.
GROUP ID: V-257794
RULE ID: SV-257794r1069362
Rationale:
Some adversaries launch attacks with the intent of executing code in nonexecutable
regions of memory or in memory locations that are prohibited. Security safeguards
employed to protect memory include, for example, data execution prevention and
address space layout randomization. Data execution prevention safeguards can be
either hardware-enforced or software-enforced with hardware providing the greater
strength of mechanism.
Poisoning writes an arbitrary value to freed pages, so any modification or reference to
that page after being freed or before being initialized will be detected and prevented.
This prevents many types of use-after-free vulnerabilities at little performance cost. Also
prevents leak of data and detection of corrupted memory.
init_on_free is a Linux kernel boot parameter that enhances security by initializing
memory regions when they are freed, preventing data leakage. This process ensures
that stale data in freed memory cannot be accessed by malicious programs.
SLUB canaries add a randomized value (canary) at the end of SLUB-allocated objects
to detect memory corruption caused by buffer overflows or underflows. Redzoning adds
padding (red zones) around SLUB-allocated objects to detect overflows or underflows
by triggering a fault when adjacent memory is accessed. SLUB canaries are often more
efficient and provide stronger detection against buffer overflows compared to redzoning.
SLUB canaries are supported in hardened Linux kernels like the ones provided by
Linux-hardened.
SLAB objects are blocks of physically contiguous memory. SLUB is the unqueued SLAB
allocator.

Profile Applicability:

Description:
RHEL 9 must restrict access to the kernel message buffer.
GROUP ID: V-257797
RULE ID: SV-257797r958514
Rationale:
Preventing unauthorized information transfers mitigates the risk of information, including
encrypted representations of information, produced by the actions of prior users/roles
(or the actions of processes acting on behalf of prior users/roles) from being available to
any current users/roles (or current processes) that obtain access to shared system
resources (e.g., registers, main memory, hard disks) after those resources have been
released back to information systems. The control of information in shared resources is
also commonly referred to as object reuse and residual information protection.
This requirement generally applies to the design of an information technology product,
but it can also apply to the configuration of particular information system components
that are, or use, such products. This can be verified by acceptance/validation processes
in DOD or other government agencies.
There may be shared resources with configurable protections (e.g., files in storage) that
may be assessed on specific information system components.
Restricting access to the kernel message buffer limits access to only root. This prevents
attackers from gaining additional system information as a nonprivileged user.

Rationale:
Changes to any software components can have significant effects on the overall
security of the operating system. This requirement ensures the software has not been
tampered with and that it has been provided by a trusted vendor.
Disabling kexec_load prevents an unsigned kernel image (that could be a windows
kernel or modified vulnerable kernel) from being loaded. Kexec can be used subvert the
entire secureboot process and should be avoided at all costs especially since it can load
unsigned kernel images.
Satisfies: SRG-OS-000480-GPOS-00227, SRG-OS-000366-GPOS-00153

Description:
RHEL 9 must restrict exposed kernel pointer addresses access.
GROUP ID: V-257800
RULE ID: SV-257800r1044851
Rationale:
Exposing kernel pointers (through procfs or "seq_printf()") exposes kernel writeable
structures, which may contain functions pointers. If a write vulnerability occurs in the
kernel, allowing write access to any of this structure, the kernel can be compromised.
This option disallows any program without the CAP_SYSLOG capability to get the
addresses of kernel pointers by replacing them with "0".

Rationale:
By enabling the fs.protected_hardlinks kernel parameter, users can no longer create
soft or hard links to files they do not own. Disallowing such hardlinks mitigates
vulnerabilities based on insecure file system accessed by privileged programs, avoiding
an exploitation vector exploiting unsafe use of open() or creat().

Rationale:
By enabling the fs.protected_symlinks kernel parameter, symbolic links are permitted to
be followed only when outside a sticky world-writable directory, or when the user
identifier (UID) of the link and follower match, or when the directory owner matches the

Description:
RHEL 9 must disable the kernel.core_pattern.
GROUP ID: V-257803
RULE ID: SV-257803r991589
Rationale:
A core dump includes a memory image taken at the time the operating system

generally useful only for developers trying to debug problems.
Audit:
Verify RHEL 9 disables storing core dumps with the following commands:
$ sudo sysctl kernel.core_pattern

1.33 RHEL-09-213070 (Automated)
Profile Applicability:
•  SEVERITY: CAT II
Description:
RHEL 9 must implement address space layout randomization (ASLR) to protect its
memory from unauthorized code execution.
GROUP ID: V-257809
RULE ID: SV-257809r1044866
Rationale:
Address space layout randomization (ASLR) makes it more difficult for an attacker to
predict the location of attack code they have introduced into a process' address space
during an attempt at exploitation. Additionally, ASLR makes it more difficult for an
attacker to know the location of existing code in order to repurpose it using return
oriented programming (ROP) techniques.
Satisfies: SRG-OS-000433-GPOS-00193, SRG-OS-000480-GPOS-00227
Audit:
Verify RHEL 9 is implementing ASLR with the following command:
$ sudo sysctl kernel.randomize_va_space
kernel.randomize_va_space = 2
Check that the configuration files are present to enable this kernel parameter.
Verify the configuration of the kernel.kptr_restrict kernel parameter with the following
command:
$ sudo /usr/lib/systemd/systemd-sysctl --cat-config | egrep -v '^(#|;)' |
grep -F kernel.randomize_va_space | tail -1
kernel.randomize_va_space = 2
If "kernel.randomize_va_space" is not set to "2" or is missing, this is a finding.
Remediation:
Add or edit the following line in a system configuration file in the "/etc/sysctl.d/"
directory:
kernel.randomize_va_space = 2

Rationale:
Loading and accessing the packet filters programs and maps using the bpf() system call
has the potential of revealing sensitive information about the kernel state.
Satisfies: SRG-OS-000132-GPOS-00067, SRG-OS-000480-GPOS-00227
Audit:
Verify that RHEL 9 prevents privilege escalation through the kernel by disabling access
to the bpf system call with the following commands:
$ sysctl kernel.unprivileged_bpf_disabled
kernel.unprivileged_bpf_disabled = 1
If the returned line does not have a value of "1", or a line is not returned, this is a
finding.
Check that the configuration files are present to enable this kernel parameter.
$ sudo /usr/lib/systemd/systemd-sysctl --cat-config | egrep -v '^(#|;)' |

If the network parameter "kernel.unprivileged_bpf_disabled" is not equal to "1", or
nothing is returned, this is a finding.
Remediation:
Configure the currently loaded kernel parameter to the secure setting:
$ sudo sysctl -w kernel.unprivileged_bpf_disabled=1
Configure RHEL 9 to prevent privilege escalation through the kernel by disabling access
to the bpf syscall by adding the following line to a file in the "/etc/sysctl.d" directory:

Description:
RHEL 9 must restrict usage of ptrace to descendant processes.
GROUP ID: V-257811
RULE ID: SV-257811r1044872
Rationale:
Unrestricted usage of ptrace allows compromised binaries to run ptrace on other
processes of the user. Like this, the attacker can steal sensitive information from the
target processes (e.g., SSH sessions, web browser, etc.) without any additional
assistance from the user (i.e., without resorting to phishing).

Rationale:
A core dump includes a memory image taken at the time the operating system
terminates an application. The memory image could contain sensitive data and is
generally useful only for developers or system operators trying to debug problems.
Enabling core dumps on production systems is not recommended; however, there may
be overriding operational requirements to enable advanced debugging. Permitting

Audit:
Verify RHEL 9 disables the use of user namespaces with the following commands:
$ sudo sysctl user.max_user_namespaces
user.max_user_namespaces = 0
If the returned line does not have a value of "0", or a line is not returned, this is a

Profile Applicability:
•  SEVERITY: CAT II
Description:
RHEL 9 must implement nonexecutable data to protect its memory from unauthorized
code execution.
GROUP ID: V-257817
RULE ID: SV-257817r1069383
Rationale:
ExecShield uses the segmentation feature on all x86 systems to prevent execution in
memory higher than a certain address. It writes an address as a limit in the code
segment descriptor, to control where code can be executed, on a per-process basis.
When the kernel places a process's memory regions such as the stack and heap higher
than this address, the hardware prevents execution in that address range. This is
enabled by default on the latest Red Hat and Fedora systems if supported by the
hardware.
Checking dmesg will return a false-positive if the system has generated enough kernel
messages that the "(Execute Disable) protection: active" line is no longer present in the
output from dmesg(1). A better way to ensure that ExecShield is enabled is to first
ensure all processors support the NX feature, and then to check that noexec was not
passed to the kernel command line.
Audit:
Verify ExecShield is enabled on 64-bit RHEL 9 systems.
Run the following command:
$ grep ^flags /proc/cpuinfo | grep -Ev '([^[:alnum:]])(nx)([^[:alnum:]]|$)'
If any output is returned, this is a finding.
Next, run the following command:
$ sudo grubby --info=ALL | grep args | grep -E
'([^[:alnum:]])(noexec)([^[:alnum:]])'
If any output is returned, this is a finding.
Remediation:
If /proc/cpuinfo shows that one or more processors do not enable ExecShield (lack the
"nx" feature flag), verify that the NX/XD feature is not disabled in the BIOS or UEFI. If it
is disabled, enable it.
If the noexec option is present on the kernel command line, update the GRUB 2
bootloader configuration to remove it by running the following command:
$ sudo grubby --update-kernel=ALL --remove-args=noexec

Description:
The kdump service on RHEL 9 must be disabled.
GROUP ID: V-257818
RULE ID: SV-257818r1044876
Rationale:
Kernel core dumps may contain the full contents of system memory at the time of the
crash. Kernel core dumps consume a considerable amount of disk space and may
result in denial of service by exhausting the available space on the target file system
partition. Unless the system is used for kernel development or testing, there is little need
to run the kdump service.
Audit:
Verify that the kdump service is disabled in system boot configuration with the following
command:
$ sudo systemctl is-enabled  kdump
disabled
Verify that the kdump service is not active (i.e., not running) through current runtime
configuration with the following command:
$ sudo systemctl is-active kdump
masked
Verify that the kdump service is masked with the following command:
$ sudo systemctl show  kdump  | grep "LoadState\|UnitFileState"
LoadState=masked
UnitFileState=masked
If the "kdump" service is loaded or active, and is not masked, this is a finding.
Remediation:
Disable and mask the kdump service on RHEL 9.
To disable the kdump service run the following command:
$ sudo systemctl disable --now kdump
To mask the kdump service run the following command:

1.43 RHEL-09-214010 (Manual)
Profile Applicability:

Description:
RHEL 9 must ensure cryptographic verification of vendor software packages.
GROUP ID: V-257819
RULE ID: SV-257819r1015075
Rationale:
Impact:
Cryptographic verification of vendor software packages ensures that all software
packages are obtained from a valid source and protects against spoofing that could lead
to installation of malware on the system. Red Hat cryptographically signs all software
packages, which includes updates, with a GPG key to verify that they are valid.
Audit:
Confirm Red Hat package-signing keys are installed on the system and verify their
fingerprints match vendor values.
Note: For RHEL 9 software packages, Red Hat uses GPG keys labeled "release key 2"
and "auxiliary key 3". The keys are defined in key file "/etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-
redhat-release" by default.
List Red Hat GPG keys installed on the system:
$ sudo rpm -q --queryformat "%{SUMMARY}\n" gpg-pubkey | grep -i "red hat"
Red Hat, Inc. (release key 2) <security@redhat.com> public key
Red Hat, Inc. (auxiliary key 3) <security@redhat.com> public key
If Red Hat GPG keys "release key 2" and "auxiliary key 3" are not installed, this is a
finding.
List key fingerprints of installed Red Hat GPG keys:
$ sudo gpg -q --keyid-format short --with-fingerprint /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-
GPG-KEY-redhat-release
If key file "/etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-redhat-release" is missing, this is a finding.
Example output:
pub   rsa4096/FD431D51 2009-10-22 [SC]
Key fingerprint = 567E 347A D004 4ADE 55BA  8A5F 199E 2F91 FD43 1D51
uid                   Red Hat, Inc. (release key 2) <security@redhat.com>
pub   rsa4096/5A6340B3 2022-03-09 [SC]
Key fingerprint = 7E46 2425 8C40 6535 D56D  6F13 5054 E4A4 5A63 40B3
uid                   Red Hat, Inc. (auxiliary key 3) <security@redhat.com>
Compare key fingerprints of installed Red Hat GPG keys with fingerprints listed for
RHEL 9 on Red Hat "Product Signing Keys" webpage at
https://access.redhat.com/security/team/key.
If key fingerprints do not match, this is a finding.
Remediation:
Install Red Hat package-signing keys on the system and verify their fingerprints match
vendor values.
Insert RHEL 9 installation disc or attach RHEL 9 installation image to the system. Mount
the disc or image to make the contents accessible inside the system.
Assuming the mounted location is "/media/cdrom", use the following command to copy
Red Hat GPG key file onto the system:
$ sudo cp /media/cdrom/RPM-GPG-KEY-redhat-release /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/
Import Red Hat GPG keys from key file into system keyring:
$ sudo rpm --import /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-redhat-release
Using the steps listed in the Check Text, confirm the newly imported keys show as
installed on the system and verify their fingerprints match vendor values.

tampered with and that it has been provided by a trusted vendor.
Audit:
Verify that all software repositories defined in "/etc/yum.repos.d/" have been configured
with "gpgcheck" enabled:
$ grep -w gpgcheck /etc/yum.repos.d/*.repo | more
gpgcheck = 1
If "gpgcheck" is not set to "1" for all returned lines, this is a finding.
Remediation:
Configure all software repositories defined in "/etc/yum.repos.d/" to have "gpgcheck"
enabled:
$ sudo sed -i 's/gpgcheck\s*=.*/gpgcheck=1/g' /etc/yum.repos.d/*

Description:
RHEL 9 must be configured so that the cryptographic hashes of system files match
vendor values.
GROUP ID: V-257823
RULE ID: SV-257823r1051231
Rationale:
The hashes of important files such as system executables should match the information
given by the RPM database. Executables with erroneous hashes could be a sign of
nefarious activity on the system.
Audit:
Verify that RHEL 9 is configured so that the cryptographic hashes of system files match
vendor values.
List files on the system that have file hashes different from what is expected by the RPM
database with the following command:
$ sudo rpm -Va --noconfig | awk '$1 ~ /..5/ && $2 != "c"'
If there is output, this is a finding.
Remediation:
Configure RHEL 9 so that the cryptographic hashes of system files match vendor
values.
Given output from the check command, identify the package that provides the output
and reinstall it. The following trimmed example output shows a package that has failed
verification, been identified, and been reinstalled:
$ sudo rpm -Va --noconfig | awk '$1 ~ /..5/ && $2 != "c"'

Description:
RHEL 9 must implement a FIPS 140-3 compliant systemwide cryptographic policy.
GROUP ID: V-258241
RULE ID: SV-258241r1051259
Rationale:
Centralized cryptographic policies simplify applying secure ciphers across an operating
system and the applications that run on that operating system. Use of weak or untested
encryption algorithms undermines the purposes of using encryption to protect data.
Satisfies: SRG-OS-000396-GPOS-00176, SRG-OS-000393-GPOS-00173, SRG-OS-
000394-GPOS-00174
Audit:
Verify that RHEL 9 is set to use a FIPS 140-3 compliant systemwide cryptographic
policy.
$ update-crypto-policies --show
FIPS
If the systemwide crypto policy is not set to "FIPS", this is a finding.
Inspect the contents of the REQUIRE.pmod file (if it exists) to ensure that only
authorized modifications to the current policy are included with the following command:
$ cat /etc/crypto-policies/policies/modules/REQUIRE.pmod
Note: If subpolicies have been configured, they could be listed in a colon-separated list
starting with FIPS as follows FIPS:<SUBPOLICY-NAME>:<SUBPOLICY-NAME>. This
is not a finding.
If the AD-SUPPORT subpolicy module is included (e.g., "FIPS:AD-SUPPORT"), and
Active Directory support is not documented as an operational requirement with the
information system security officer (ISSO), this is a finding.
If the NO-ENFORCE-EMS subpolicy module is included (e.g., "FIPS:NO-ENFORCE-
EMS"), and not enforcing EMS is not documented as an operational requirement with
the ISSO, this is a finding.
Verify the current minimum crypto-policy configuration with the following commands:
$ grep -E 'rsa_size|hash' /etc/crypto-policies/state/CURRENT.pol
hash = SHA2-256 SHA2-384 SHA2-512 SHA2-224 SHA3-256 SHA3-384 SHA3-512 SHAKE-
256
min_rsa_size = 2048
If the "hash" values do not include at least the following FIPS 140-3 compliant
algorithms "SHA2-256 SHA2-384 SHA2-512 SHA2-224 SHA3-256 SHA3-384 SHA3-
512 SHAKE-256", this is a finding.
If there are algorithms that include "SHA1" or a hash value less than "256" this is a
finding.
If the "min_rsa_size" is not set to a value of at least 2048, this is a finding.
If these commands do not return any output, this is a finding.
Remediation:
Configure RHEL 9 to use a FIPS 140-3 compliant systemwide cryptographic policy.
Create subpolicies for enhancements to the systemwide crypto-policy with the following
commands:
Create or edit the SCOPES-AND-WILDCARDS policy module in a text editor and insert
options that modify the systemwide cryptographic policy as follows:
$ sudo vi /etc/crypto-policies/policies/modules/SCOPES-AND-WILDCARDS.pmod
Add the following lines to the policy:
# Disable CHACHA20-POLY1305 for the TLS protocol (OpenSSL, GnuTLS, NSS, and
OpenJDK)
cipher@TLS = -CHACHA20-POLY1305
# Disable all CBC mode ciphers for the SSH protocol (libssh and OpenSSH)
cipher@SSH = -*-CBC
Create or edit the OPENSSH-SUBPOLICY module in a text editor and insert options
that modify the systemwide crypto-policy as follows:
$ sudo vi /etc/crypto-policies/policies/modules/OPENSSH-SUBPOLICY.pmod
Add the following lines to the policy:
# Define ciphers for OpenSSH
cipher@SSH=AES-256-GCM AES-128-GCM AES-256-CTR AES-128-CTR
# Define MACs for OpenSSH
mac@SSH=HMAC-SHA2-512 HMAC-SHA2-256
Create or edit the REQUIRE.pmod file and add the following lines to include the
subpolicies in the FIPS configuration with the following command:
$ sudo vi /etc/crypto-policies/policies/modules/REQUIRE.pmod
Add the following lines to REQUIRE.pmod:
@OPENSSH-SUBPOLICY
@SCOPES-AND-WILDCARDS
Apply the policy enhancements to the FIPS systemwide cryptographic policy level with
the following command:
$ sudo update-crypto-policies --set FIPS
Note: If additional subpolicies are being employed, they should be added to the
REQUIRE.pmod as well. REQUIRE.pmod is included in the systemwide crypto-policy
when it is set.
To make the cryptographic settings effective for already running services and
applications, restart the system:
$ sudo reboot

RHEL 9 must prevent device files from being interpreted on file systems that contain
user home directories.
GROUP ID: V-257850
RULE ID: SV-257850r1044930
Rationale:
The "nodev" mount option causes the system to not interpret character or block special
devices. Executing character or block special devices from untrusted file systems
increases the opportunity for nonprivileged users to attain unauthorized administrative
access.
The only legitimate location for device files is the "/dev" directory located on the root

Audit:
Verify "/home" is mounted with the "nodev" option with the following command:
Note: If a separate file system has not been created for the user home directories (user

systems that contain user home directories.
GROUP ID: V-257851
RULE ID: SV-257851r1044932
Rationale:
The "nosuid" mount option causes the system to not execute "setuid" and "setgid" files

Profile Applicability:
•  SEVERITY: CAT I
Description:
RHEL 9 local disk partitions must implement cryptographic mechanisms to prevent
unauthorized disclosure or modification of all information that requires at rest protection.
GROUP ID: V-257879
RULE ID: SV-257879r1045454
Rationale:
RHEL 9 systems handling data requiring "data at rest" protections must employ
cryptographic mechanisms to prevent unauthorized disclosure and modification of the
information at rest.
Selection of a cryptographic mechanism is based on the need to protect the integrity of
organizational information. The strength of the mechanism is commensurate with the
security category and/or classification of the information. Organizations have the
flexibility to either encrypt all information on storage devices (i.e., full disk encryption) or
encrypt specific data structures (e.g., files, records, or fields).
Satisfies: SRG-OS-000405-GPOS-00184, SRG-OS-000185-GPOS-00079, SRG-OS-
000404-GPOS-00183
Audit:
Note: If there is a documented and approved reason for not having data-at-rest
encryption at the operating system level, such as encryption provided by a hypervisor or
a disk storage array in a virtualized environment, this requirement is Not Applicable.
Verify RHEL 9 prevents unauthorized disclosure or modification of all information
requiring at-rest protection by using disk encryption.
Note: If there is a documented and approved reason for not having data-at-rest
encryption, this requirement is Not Applicable.

Verify that the block device tree for each persistent filesystem, excluding the /boot and
/boot/efi filesystems, has at least one parent block device of type "crypt", and that the
encryption type is LUKS:
$ sudo cryptsetup status luks-b74f6910-2547-4399-86b2-8b0252d926d7
/dev/mapper/luks-b74f6910-2547-4399-86b2-8b0252d926d7 is active and is in
use.
type:    LUKS2
cipher:  aes-xts-plain64

sector size:  512
offset:  32768 sectors
size:    995986063 sectors
mode:    read/write
If there are persistent filesystems (other than /boot or /boot/efi) whose block device
trees do not have a crypt block device of type LUKS, ask the administrator to indicate
how persistent filesystems are encrypted.
If there is no evidence that persistent filesystems are encrypted, this is a finding.
Remediation:
Configure RHEL 9 to prevent unauthorized modification of all information at rest by
using disk encryption.
Encrypting a partition in an already installed system is more difficult, because existing
partitions will need to be resized and changed.
To encrypt an entire partition, dedicate a partition for encryption in the partition layout.

Description:
RHEL 9 must disable mounting of cramfs.
GROUP ID: V-257880
RULE ID: SV-257880r1044951
Rationale:
It is detrimental for operating systems to provide, or install by default, functionality
exceeding requirements or mission objectives. These unnecessary capabilities or
services are often overlooked and therefore may remain unsecured. They increase the
risk to the platform by providing additional attack vectors.
Removing support for unneeded filesystem types reduces the local attack surface of the
server.
Compressed ROM/RAM file system (or cramfs) is a read-only file system designed for
simplicity and space-efficiency. It is mainly used in embedded and small-footprint
systems.
Audit:
Verify that RHEL 9 disables the ability to load the cramfs kernel module with the
following command:
$ grep -r cramfs /etc/modprobe.conf /etc/modprobe.d/*
install cramfs /bin/false
blacklist cramfs
If the command does not return any output or the lines are commented out, and use of
cramfs is not documented with the information system security officer (ISSO) as an
operational requirement, this is a finding.
Remediation:
To configure the system to prevent the cramfs kernel module from being loaded, add
the following lines to the file /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf (or create blacklist.conf if it
does not exist):
install cramfs /bin/false
blacklist cramfs

Description:
RHEL 9 /var/log/messages file must have mode 0640 or less permissive.
GROUP ID: V-257886
RULE ID: SV-257886r1044955
Rationale:
Only authorized personnel should be aware of errors and the details of the errors. Error
messages are an indicator of an organization's operational state or can identify the
RHEL 9 system or platform. Additionally, personally identifiable information (PII) and
operational information must not be revealed through error messages to unauthorized
personnel or their designated representatives.
The structure and content of error messages must be carefully considered by the
organization and development team. The extent to which the information system is able
to identify and handle error conditions is guided by organizational policy and operational
requirements.
Audit:
Verify the "/var/log/messages" file has a mode of "0640" or less permissive with the
following command:
$ stat -c '%a %n' /var/log/messages
600 /var/log/messages
If "/var/log/messages" does not have a mode of "0640" or less permissive, this is a
finding.
Remediation:
Configure the "/var/log/messages" file to have a mode of "0640" by running the following
command:
$ sudo chmod 0640 /var/log/messages

Description:
RHEL 9 audit tools must have a mode of 0755 or less permissive.
GROUP ID: V-257887
RULE ID: SV-257887r991557
Rationale:
Protecting audit information also includes identifying and protecting the tools used to
view and manipulate log data. Therefore, protecting audit tools is necessary to prevent
unauthorized operation on audit information.
RHEL 9 systems providing tools to interface with audit information will leverage user
permissions and roles identifying the user accessing the tools, and the corresponding
rights the user enjoys, to make access decisions regarding the access to audit tools.
Audit tools include, but are not limited to, vendor-provided and open source audit tools
needed to successfully view and manipulate audit information system activity and
records. Audit tools include custom queries and report generators.
Audit:
Verify the audit tools have a mode of "0755" or less with the following command:
$ stat -c "%a %n" /sbin/auditctl /sbin/aureport /sbin/ausearch /sbin/autrace
/sbin/auditd /sbin/rsyslogd /sbin/augenrules
755 /sbin/auditctl

755 /sbin/ausearch
750 /sbin/autrace
755 /sbin/auditd
755 /sbin/rsyslogd
755 /sbin/augenrules
If any of the audit tool files have a mode more permissive than "0755", this is a finding.
Remediation:
Configure the audit tools to have a mode of "0755" by running the following command:
$ sudo chmod 0755 [audit_tool]
Replace "[audit_tool]" with each audit tool that has a more permissive mode than 0755.

RHEL 9 permissions of cron configuration files and directories must not be modified
from the operating system defaults.
GROUP ID: V-257888
RULE ID: SV-257888r1069378
Rationale:
If the permissions of cron configuration files or directories are modified from the
operating system defaults, it may be possible for individuals to insert unauthorized cron
jobs that perform unauthorized actions, including potentially escalating privileges.
Audit:
Run the following command to verify that the owner, group, and mode of cron
configuration files and directories match the operating system defaults:
$ rpm --verify cronie crontabs | awk '! ($2 == "c" && $1 ~
/^.\..\.\.\.\..\./) {print $0}'
If the command returns any output, this is a finding.
Remediation:
Run the following commands to restore the permissions of cron configuration files and
directories to the operating system defaults:
$ sudo dnf reinstall cronie crontabs
$ rpm --setugids cronie crontabs
$ rpm --setperms cronie crontabs

Description:
All RHEL 9 local initialization files must have mode 0740 or less permissive.
GROUP ID: V-257889
RULE ID: SV-257889r1044959
Rationale:
Local initialization files are used to configure the user's shell environment upon logon.
Malicious modification of these files could compromise accounts upon logon.
Audit:
Verify that all local initialization files have a mode of "0740" or less permissive with the
following command:
Note: The example will be for the "bingwa" user, who has a home directory of
"/home/bingwa".
$ find /home/bingwa/.[^.]* -maxdepth 0 -perm -740 -exec stat -c "%a %n" {} \;
| more
755 /home/bingwa/.somepermissivefile
If any local initialization files are returned, this indicates a mode more permissive than
"0740", and this is a finding.
Remediation:
Set the mode of the local initialization files to "0740" with the following command:
Note: The example will be for the wadea user, who has a home directory of
"/home/wadea".
$ sudo chmod 0740 /home/wadea/.<INIT_FILE>

All RHEL 9 local interactive user home directories must have mode 0750 or less
permissive.
GROUP ID: V-257890
RULE ID: SV-257890r1044961
Rationale:
Excessive permissions on local interactive user home directories may allow
unauthorized access to user files by other users.
Audit:
Verify the assigned home directory of all local interactive users has a mode of "0750" or
less permissive with the following command:
Note: This may miss interactive users that have been assigned a privileged user
identifier (UID). Evidence of interactive use may be obtained from a number of log files
containing system logon information.
$ stat -L -c '%a %n' $(awk -F: '($3>=1000)&&($7 !~ /nologin/){print $6}'
/etc/passwd) 2>/dev/null
700 /home/bingwa
If home directories referenced in "/etc/passwd" do not have a mode of "0750" or less
permissive, this is a finding.
Remediation:
Change the mode of interactive user's home directories to "0750". To change the mode
of a local interactive user's home directory, use the following command:
Note: The example will be for the user "wadea".

Description:
RHEL 9 library directories must be group-owned by root or a system account.
GROUP ID: V-257923
RULE ID: SV-257923r1044991
Rationale:
If RHEL 9 allowed any user to make changes to software libraries, then those changes
might be implemented without undergoing the appropriate testing and approvals that
are part of a robust change management process.
This requirement applies to RHEL 9 with software libraries that are accessible and
configurable, as in the case of interpreted languages. Software libraries also include
privileged programs that execute with escalated privileges.
Audit:
Verify the systemwide shared library directories are group-owned by "root" with the
following command:
$ sudo find /lib /lib64 /usr/lib /usr/lib64 ! -group root -type d -exec stat
-c "%G %n" {} \;
If any systemwide shared library directory is returned and is not group-owned by a
required system account, this is a finding.
Remediation:
Configure the systemwide shared library directories (/lib, /lib64, /usr/lib and /usr/lib64) to
be protected from unauthorized access.
Run the following command, replacing "[DIRECTORY]" with any library directory not
group-owned by "root".
$ sudo chgrp root [DIRECTORY]

unauthorized operation on audit information.
RHEL 9 systems providing tools to interface with audit information will leverage user
permissions and roles identifying the user accessing the tools, and the corresponding

Audit tools include, but are not limited to, vendor-provided and open source audit tools
needed to successfully view and manipulate audit information system activity and
records. Audit tools include custom queries and report generators.
Audit:
Verify the audit tools are owned by "root" with the following command:

All RHEL 9 world-writable directories must be owned by root, sys, bin, or an application
user.
GROUP ID: V-257928
RULE ID: SV-257928r1044992
Rationale:
If a world-writable directory is not owned by root, sys, bin, or an application user
identifier (UID), unauthorized users may be able to modify files created by others.
The only authorized public directories are those temporary directories supplied with the
system or those designed to be temporary file repositories. The setting is normally
reserved for directories used by the system and by users for temporary file storage,
(e.g., /tmp), and for directories requiring global read/write access.
Satisfies: SRG-OS-000480-GPOS-00227, SRG-OS-000138-GPOS-00069
Audit:
Verify that world writable directories are owned by root, a system account, or an

directories that are not owned by root. Run it once for each local partition [PART]:
$ sudo find  PART  -xdev -type d -perm -0002 -uid +0 -print
If there is output, this is a finding.
Remediation:
Configure all public directories to be owned by root or a system account to prevent
unauthorized and unintended information transferred via shared system resources.

Description:
A sticky bit must be set on all RHEL 9 public directories.
GROUP ID: V-257929
RULE ID: SV-257929r958524
Rationale:
Preventing unauthorized information transfers mitigates the risk of information, including
encrypted representations of information, produced by the actions of prior users/roles
(or the actions of processes acting on behalf of prior users/roles) from being available to
any current users/roles (or current processes) that obtain access to shared system
resources (e.g., registers, main memory, hard disks) after those resources have been
released back to information systems. The control of information in shared resources is
also commonly referred to as object reuse and residual information protection.
This requirement generally applies to the design of an information technology product,
but it can also apply to the configuration of particular information system components
that are, or use, such products. This can be verified by acceptance/validation processes
in DOD or other government agencies.
Audit:
Verify that all world-writable directories have the sticky bit set.
Determine if all world-writable directories have the sticky bit set by running the following
command:
$ sudo find / -type d \( -perm -0002 -a ! -perm -1000 \) -print 2>/dev/null
drwxrwxrwt 7 root root 4096 Jul 26 11:19 /tmp
If any of the returned directories are world-writable and do not have the sticky bit set,
this is a finding.
Remediation:
Configure all world-writable directories to have the sticky bit set to prevent unauthorized
and unintended information transferred via shared system resources.
Set the sticky bit on all world-writable directories using the command, replace "[World-
Writable Directory]" with any directory path missing the sticky bit:
$ chmod a+t [World-Writable Directory]

RHEL 9 must be configured so that all system device files are correctly labeled to
prevent unauthorized modification.
GROUP ID: V-257932
RULE ID: SV-257932r1014838
Rationale:
If an unauthorized or modified device is allowed to exist on the system, there is the
possibility the system may perform unintended or unauthorized operations.
Audit:
Verify that all system device files are correctly labeled to prevent unauthorized
modification.
List all device files on the system that are incorrectly labeled with the following
commands:
Note: Device files are normally found under "/dev", but applications may place device
files in other directories and may necessitate a search of the entire system.
# find /dev -context *:device_t:* \( -type c -o -type b \) -printf "%p %Z\n"
# find /dev -context *:unlabeled_t:* \( -type c -o -type b \) -printf "%p
%Z\n"
Note: There are device files, such as "/dev/vmci", that are used when the operating
system is a host virtual machine. They will not be owned by a user on the system and
require the "device_t" label to operate. These device files are not a finding.
If there is output from either of these commands, other than already noted, this is a
finding.
Remediation:
Restore the SELinux policy for the affected device file from the system policy database
using the following command:
$ sudo restorecon -v <device_path>
Substitute "<device_path>" with the path to the affected device file (from the output of
the previous commands). An example device file path would be "/dev/ttyUSB0". If the
output of the above command does not indicate that the device was relabeled to a more
specific SELinux type label, then the SELinux policy of the system must be updated with
more specific policy for the device class specified. If a package was used to install
support for a device class, that package could be reinstalled using the following
command:
$ sudo dnf reinstall <package_name>
If a package was not used to install the SELinux policy for a given device class, then it
must be generated manually and provide specific type labels.

this file to root provides the designated owner with access to sensitive information,
which could weaken the system security posture.

Rationale:
"Firewalld" provides an easy and effective way to block/limit remote access to the

Remote access services, such as those providing remote access to network devices
and information systems, which lack automated control capabilities, increase risk and

Remote access is access to DOD nonpublic information systems by an authorized user
(or an information system) communicating through an external, nonorganization-
controlled network. Remote access methods include, for example, dial-up, broadband,
and wireless.
RHEL 9 functionality (e.g., SSH) must be capable of taking enforcement action if the
audit reveals unauthorized activity. Automated control of remote access sessions allows
organizations to ensure ongoing compliance with remote access policies by enforcing
connection rules of remote access applications on a variety of information system

Description:
A RHEL 9 firewall must employ a deny-all, allow-by-exception policy for allowing
connections to other systems.
GROUP ID: V-257937
RULE ID: SV-257937r991589
Rationale:
Failure to restrict network connectivity only to authorized systems permits inbound
connections from malicious systems. It also permits outbound connections that may
facilitate exfiltration of DOD data.
RHEL 9 incorporates the "firewalld" daemon, which allows for many different
configurations. One of these configurations is zones. Zones can be utilized to a deny-all,
allow-by-exception approach. The default "drop" zone will drop all incoming network
packets unless it is explicitly allowed by the configuration file or is related to an outgoing
network connection.
Audit:
Verify the RHEL 9 "firewalld" is configured to employ a deny-all, allow-by-exception
policy for allowing connections to other systems with the following commands:
$ sudo  firewall-cmd --state
running
$ sudo firewall-cmd --get-active-zones
public
interfaces: ens33
$ sudo firewall-cmd --info-zone=public | grep target
target: DROP
$ sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --info-zone=public | grep target
target: DROP
If no zones are active on the RHEL 9 interfaces or if runtime and permanent targets are
set to a different option other than "DROP", this is a finding.
Remediation:
Configure the "firewalld" daemon to employ a deny-all, allow-by-exception with the
following commands:
Start by adding the exceptions that are required for mission functionality to the "drop"
zone. If SSH access on port 22 is needed, for example, run the following:
$ sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=ssh --zone=drop
Reload the firewall rules to update the runtime configuration from the "--permanent"
changes made above:
$ sudo firewall-cmd --reload
Set the default zone to the drop zone:
$ sudo firewall-cmd --set-default-zone=drop
Note: This is a runtime and permanent change.
Add any interfaces to the newly modified "drop" zone:
$ sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=drop --change-interface=ens33
Reload the firewall rules for changes to take effect:
$ sudo firewall-cmd --reload

attacks that have occurred or are ongoing on system availability. For each system,
known and potential DoS attacks must be identified and solutions for each type
implemented. A variety of technologies exists to limit or, in some cases, eliminate the
effects of DoS attacks (e.g., limiting processes or establishing memory partitions).
Employing increased capacity and bandwidth, combined with service redundancy, may
reduce the susceptibility to some DoS attacks.
Audit:
Verify "nftables" is configured to allow rate limits on any connection to the system with
the following command:
$ sudo grep -i firewallbackend /etc/firewalld/firewalld.conf
# FirewallBackend
FirewallBackend=nftables
If the "nftables" is not set as the "FirewallBackend" default, this is a finding.
Remediation:
Configure "nftables" to be the default "firewallbackend" for "firewalld" by adding or
editing the following line in "/etc/firewalld/firewalld.conf":
FirewallBackend=nftables
Establish rate-limiting rules based on organization-defined types of DoS attacks on
impacted network interfaces.

Profile Applicability:
•  SEVERITY: CAT II
Description:
RHEL 9 must be configured to prohibit or restrict the use of functions, ports, protocols,
and/or services, as defined in the Ports, Protocols, and Services Management (PPSM)
Category Assignments List (CAL) and vulnerability assessments.
GROUP ID: V-257940
RULE ID: SV-257940r958480
Rationale:
To prevent unauthorized connection of devices, unauthorized transfer of information, or
unauthorized tunneling (i.e., embedding of data types within data types), organizations
must disable or restrict unused or unnecessary ports, protocols, and services on
information systems.
Audit:
Inspect the firewall configuration and running services to verify it is configured to prohibit
or restrict the use of functions, ports, protocols, and/or services that are unnecessary or
prohibited.
Check which services are currently active with the following command:
$ sudo firewall-cmd --list-all-zones
custom (active)
target: DROP
icmp-block-inversion: no
interfaces: ens33
sources:
services: dhcpv6-client dns http https ldaps rpc-bind ssh
ports:
masquerade: no
forward-ports:
icmp-blocks:
rich rules:
Ask the system administrator for the site or program Ports, Protocols, and Services
Management Component Local Service Assessment (PPSM CLSA). Verify the services
allowed by the firewall match the PPSM CLSA.
If there are additional ports, protocols, or services that are not in the PPSM CLSA, or
there are ports, protocols, or services that are prohibited by the PPSM Category
Assurance List (CAL), this is a finding.
Remediation:
Update the host's firewall settings and/or running services to comply with the PPSM
CLSA for the site or program and the PPSM CAL.
Then run the following command to load the newly created rule(s):
$ sudo firewall-cmd --reload

Description:
RHEL 9 network interfaces must not be in promiscuous mode.
GROUP ID: V-257941
RULE ID: SV-257941r991589
Rationale:
Network interfaces in promiscuous mode allow for the capture of all network traffic
visible to the system. If unauthorized individuals can access these applications, it may
allow them to collect information such as logon IDs, passwords, and key exchanges
between systems.
If the system is being used to perform a network troubleshooting function, the use of
these tools must be documented with the information systems security officer (ISSO)
and restricted to only authorized personnel.
Audit:
Verify network interfaces are not in promiscuous mode with the following command:
$ ip link | grep -i promisc
If network interfaces are found on the system in promiscuous mode and their use has
not been approved by the ISSO and documented, this is a finding.
Remediation:
Configure network interfaces to turn off promiscuous mode unless approved by the
ISSO and documented.
Set the promiscuous mode of an interface to off with the following command:
$ sudo ip link set dev <devicename> multicast off promisc off

Description:
RHEL 9 must enable hardening for the Berkeley Packet Filter just-in-time compiler.
GROUP ID: V-257942
RULE ID: SV-257942r1044999
Rationale:
When hardened, the extended Berkeley Packet Filter (BPF) just-in-time (JIT) compiler
will randomize any kernel addresses in the BPF programs and maps, and will not
expose the JIT addresses in "/proc/kallsyms".
Audit:
Verify RHEL 9 enables hardening for the BPF JIT with the following commands:
$ sudo sysctl net.core.bpf_jit_harden
net.core.bpf_jit_harden = 2
If the returned line does not have a value of "2", or a line is not returned, this is a
finding.
Check that the configuration files are present to enable this kernel parameter.
$ sudo /usr/lib/systemd/systemd-sysctl --cat-config | egrep -v '^(#|;)' |
grep -F net.core.bpf_jit_harden | tail -1
net.core.bpf_jit_harden = 2
If the network parameter "net.core.bpf_jit_harden" is not equal to "2" or nothing is
returned, this is a finding.
Remediation:
Configure RHEL 9 to enable hardening for the BPF JIT compiler by adding the following
line to a file, in the "/etc/sysctl.d" directory:
net.core.bpf_jit_harden = 2
The system configuration files need to be reloaded for the changes to take effect. To
reload the contents of the files, run the following command:

RHEL 9 systems using Domain Name Servers (DNS) resolution must have at least two
name servers configured.
GROUP ID: V-257948
RULE ID: SV-257948r1045004
Rationale:
To provide availability for name resolution services, multiple redundant name servers
are mandated. A failure in name resolution could lead to the failure of security functions
requiring name resolution, which may include time synchronization, centralized
authentication, and remote system logging.
Audit:
Note: If the system is running in a cloud platform and the cloud provider gives a single,
highly available IP address for DNS configuration, this control is Not Applicable.
Verify the name servers used by the system with the following command:
$ grep nameserver /etc/resolv.conf
nameserver 192.168.1.2
nameserver 192.168.1.3
If fewer than two lines are returned that are not commented out, this is a finding.
Remediation:
Configure the operating system to use two or more name servers for DNS resolution
based on the DNS mode of the system.
If the NetworkManager DNS mode is set to "none", add the following lines to
"/etc/resolv.conf":
nameserver [name server 1]
nameserver [name server 2]
Replace [name server 1] and [name server 2] with the IPs of two different DNS
resolvers.
If the NetworkManager DNS mode is set to "default", add two DNS servers to a
NetworkManager connection using the following command:
$ nmcli connection modify [connection name] ipv4.dns [name server 1],[name

RULE ID: SV-257953r958424
Rationale:
It is critical for the appropriate personnel to be aware if a system is at risk of failing to
process audit logs as required. Without this notification, the security personnel may be
unaware of an impending failure of the audit capability, and system operation may be
adversely affected.
Audit processing failures include software/hardware errors, failures in the audit
capturing mechanisms, and audit storage capacity being reached or exceeded.
Audit:
Verify that the administrators are notified in the event of an audit processing failure.
Check that the "/etc/aliases" file has a defined value for "root".
$ sudo grep "postmaster:\s*root$" /etc/aliases
If the command does not return a line, or the line is commented out, ask the system
administrator to indicate how they and the information systems security officer (ISSO)
are notified of an audit process failure. If there is no evidence of the proper personnel
being notified of an audit processing failure, this is a finding.

Profile Applicability:
•  SEVERITY: CAT I
Description:
There must be no .shosts files on RHEL 9.
GROUP ID: V-257956
RULE ID: SV-257956r991589
Rationale:
The .shosts files are used to configure host-based authentication for individual users or
the system via SSH. Host-based authentication is not sufficient for preventing
unauthorized access to the system, as it does not require interactive identification and
authentication of a connection request, or for the use of two-factor authentication.
Audit:
Verify there are no ".shosts" files on RHEL 9 with the following command:
$ sudo find / -name .shosts
If a ".shosts" file is found, this is a finding.
Remediation:
Remove any found ".shosts" files from the system.
$ sudo rm /[path]/[to]/[file]/.shosts

Profile Applicability:
•  SEVERITY: CAT II
Description:
RHEL 9 must be configured to use TCP syncookies.
GROUP ID: V-257957
RULE ID: SV-257957r1045009
Rationale:
Denial of service (DoS) is a condition when a resource is not available for legitimate
users. When this occurs, the organization either cannot accomplish its mission or must
operate at degraded capacity.
Managing excess capacity ensures that sufficient capacity is available to counter
flooding attacks. Employing increased capacity and service redundancy may reduce the
susceptibility to some DoS attacks. Managing excess capacity may include, for
example, establishing selected usage priorities, quotas, or partitioning.
Satisfies: SRG-OS-000480-GPOS-00227, SRG-OS-000420-GPOS-00186, SRG-OS-
000142-GPOS-00071
Audit:
Verify RHEL 9 is configured to use IPv4 TCP syncookies.
Determine if syncookies are used with the following command:
Check the status of the kernel.perf_event_paranoid kernel parameter.
$ sudo sysctl net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies
net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies = 1
Check that the configuration files are present to enable this kernel parameter.
$ sudo /usr/lib/systemd/systemd-sysctl --cat-config | egrep -v '^(#|;)' |
grep -F net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies | tail -1
net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies = 1
If the network parameter "ipv4.tcp_syncookies" is not equal to "1" or nothing is returned,
this is a finding.
Remediation:
Configure RHEL 9 to use TCP syncookies.
Add or edit the following line in a system configuration file in the "/etc/sysctl.d/"
directory:
net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies = 1
Load settings from all system configuration files with the following command:

Protocol (ICMP) redirect messages.
GROUP ID: V-257958

Rationale:
ICMP redirect messages are used by routers to inform hosts that a more direct route
exists for a particular destination. These messages modify the host's route table and are
unauthenticated. An illicit ICMP redirect message could result in a man-in-the-middle
attack.

Description:
RHEL 9 must not forward Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) source-routed packets.
GROUP ID: V-257959
RULE ID: SV-257959r991589
Rationale:
Source-routed packets allow the source of the packet to suggest routers forward the
packet along a different path than configured on the router, which can be used to
bypass network security measures. This requirement applies only to the forwarding of
source-routerd traffic, such as when IPv4 forwarding is enabled and the system is
functioning as a router.
Accepting source-routed packets in the IPv4 protocol has few legitimate uses. It must
be disabled unless it is absolutely required.

exists for a particular destination. These messages contain information from the
system's route table possibly revealing portions of the network topology.
The ability to send ICMP redirects is only appropriate for systems acting as routers.
Audit:
Verify RHEL 9 does not allow interfaces to perform Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4)
ICMP redirects by default.
Check the value of the "default send_redirects" variables with the following command:
$ sudo sysctl net.ipv4.conf.default.send_redirects
net.ipv4.conf.default.send_redirects=0
If the returned line does not have a value of "0", or a line is not returned, this is a
finding.
Check that the configuration files are present to enable this network parameter.
$ sudo /usr/lib/systemd/systemd-sysctl --cat-config | egrep -v '^(#|;)' |
grep -F net.ipv4.conf.default.send_redirects | tail -1
net.ipv4.conf.default.send_redirects = 0
If "net.ipv4.conf.default.send_redirects" is not set to "0" and is not documented with the
information system security officer (ISSO) as an operational requirement or is missing,
this is a finding.
Remediation:
Configure RHEL 9 to not allow interfaces to perform Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4)
ICMP redirects by default.
Add or edit the following line in a single system configuration file, in the "/etc/sysctl.d/"
directory:
net.ipv4.conf.default.send_redirects = 0

1.207 RHEL-09-255030 (Automated)
Profile Applicability:
•  SEVERITY: CAT II
Description:
RHEL 9 must log SSH connection attempts and failures to the server.
GROUP ID: V-257982
RULE ID: SV-257982r1045021
Rationale:
SSH provides several logging levels with varying amounts of verbosity. "DEBUG" is
specifically not recommended other than strictly for debugging SSH communications
since it provides so much data that it is difficult to identify important security information.
"INFO" or "VERBOSE" level is the basic level that only records login activity of SSH
users. In many situations, such as Incident Response, it is important to determine when
a particular user was active on a system. The logout record can eliminate those users
who disconnected, which helps narrow the field.
Audit:
Verify that RHEL 9 logs SSH connection attempts and failures to the server.
Check what the SSH daemon's "LogLevel" option is set to with the following command:
$ sudo /usr/sbin/sshd -dd 2>&1 | awk '/filename/ {print $4}' | tr -d '\r' |
tr '\n' ' ' | xargs sudo grep -iH '^\s*loglevel'
LogLevel VERBOSE
If a value of "VERBOSE" is not returned or the line is commented out or missing, this is
a finding.
Remediation:
Configure RHEL 9 to log connection attempts add or modify the following line in
"/etc/ssh/sshd_config" or in a file in "/etc/ssh/sshd_config.d".
LogLevel VERBOSE
Restart the SSH daemon for the settings to take effect:

Description:
RHEL 9 SSHD must accept public key authentication.
GROUP ID: V-257983
RULE ID: SV-257983r1045024
Rationale:
Without the use of multifactor authentication, the ease of access to privileged functions
is greatly increased. Multifactor authentication requires using two or more factors to
achieve authentication. A privileged account is defined as an information system
account with authorizations of a privileged user. A DOD common access card (CAC)
with DOD-approved PKI is an example of multifactor authentication.
Satisfies: SRG-OS-000105-GPOS-00052, SRG-OS-000106-GPOS-00053, SRG-OS-

Audit:
Note: If the system administrator demonstrates the use of an approved alternate
multifactor authentication method, this requirement is Not Applicable.
Verify that RHEL 9 SSH daemon accepts public key encryption with the following
command:
$ sudo /usr/sbin/sshd -dd 2>&1 | awk '/filename/ {print $4}' | tr -d '\r' |
tr '\n' ' ' | xargs sudo grep -iH '^\s*pubkeyauthentication'
PubkeyAuthentication yes
If "PubkeyAuthentication" is set to no, the line is commented out, or the line is missing,
this is a finding.

Description:
RHEL 9 SSHD must not allow blank passwords.
GROUP ID: V-257984
RULE ID: SV-257984r1045026
Rationale:
If an account has an empty password, anyone could log on and run commands with the
privileges of that account. Accounts with empty passwords should never be used in
operational environments.
Satisfies: SRG-OS-000106-GPOS-00053, SRG-OS-000480-GPOS-00229, SRG-OS-

Description:
RHEL 9 must not permit direct logons to the root account using remote access via SSH.
GROUP ID: V-257985
RULE ID: SV-257985r1069364
Rationale:
Even though the communications channel may be encrypted, an additional layer of
security is gained by extending the policy of not logging directly on as root. In addition,
logging in with a user-specific account provides individual accountability of actions
performed on the system and also helps to minimize direct attack attempts on root's
password.
Satisfies: SRG-OS-000109-GPOS-00056, SRG-OS-000480-GPOS-00227
Audit:
Verify RHEL 9 remote access using SSH prevents users from logging on directly as
"root" with the following command:
$ sudo /usr/sbin/sshd -dd 2>&1 | awk '/filename/ {print $4}' | tr -d '\r' |
tr '\n' ' ' | xargs sudo grep -iH '^\s*permitrootlogin'
PermitRootLogin no
If the "PermitRootLogin" keyword is set to any value other than "no", is missing, or is

Description:
RHEL 9 must enable the Pluggable Authentication Module (PAM) interface for SSHD.
GROUP ID: V-257986
RULE ID: SV-257986r1045030
Rationale:
When UsePAM is set to "yes", PAM runs through account and session types properly.
This is important when restricted access to services based off of IP, time, or other
factors of the account is needed. Additionally, this ensures users can inherit certain
environment variables on login or disallow access to the server.
Audit:
Verify the RHEL 9 SSHD is configured to allow for the UsePAM interface with the
following command:
$ sudo /usr/sbin/sshd -dd 2>&1 | awk '/filename/ {print $4}' | tr -d '\r' |
tr '\n' ' ' | xargs sudo grep -iH '^\s*usepam'
UsePAM yes
If the "UsePAM" keyword is set to "no", is missing, or is commented out, this is a finding.
Remediation:
Configure the RHEL 9 SSHD to use the UsePAM interface by adding or modifying the
following line in "/etc/ssh/sshd_config" or in a file in "/etc/ssh/sshd_config.d".
UsePAM yes

Description:
RHEL 9 SSH daemon must be configured to use system-wide crypto policies
GROUP ID: V-257987
RULE ID: SV-257987r1014852
Rationale:
Without cryptographic integrity protections, information can be altered by unauthorized
users without detection.
Remote access (e.g., RDP) is access to DOD nonpublic information systems by an
authorized user (or an information system) communicating through an external,
nonorganization-controlled network. Remote access methods include, for example, dial-
up, broadband, and wireless.
Cryptographic mechanisms used for protecting the integrity of information include, for
example, signed hash functions using asymmetric cryptography enabling distribution of
the public key to verify the hash information while maintaining the confidentiality of the
secret key used to generate the hash.
Audit:
Verify that systemwide crypto policies are in effect with the following command:
$ sudo /usr/sbin/sshd -dd 2>&1 | awk '/filename/ {print $4}' | tr -d '\r' |
tr '\n' ' ' | xargs sudo grep -iH '^\s*include'

Description:
RHEL 9 must force a frequent session key renegotiation for SSH connections to the
server.
GROUP ID: V-257994
RULE ID: SV-257994r1045051
Rationale:
Without protection of the transmitted information, confidentiality and integrity may be
compromised because unprotected communications can be intercepted and either read
or altered.
This requirement applies to both internal and external networks and all types of
information system components from which information can be transmitted (e.g.,
servers, mobile devices, notebook computers, printers, copiers, scanners, and facsimile
machines). Communication paths outside the physical protection of a controlled
boundary are exposed to the possibility of interception and modification.
Protecting the confidentiality and integrity of organizational information can be
accomplished by physical means (e.g., employing physical distribution systems) or by
logical means (e.g., employing cryptographic techniques). If physical means of
protection are employed, then logical means (cryptography) do not have to be
employed, and vice versa.
Session key regeneration limits the chances of a session key becoming compromised.

If "RekeyLimit" does not have a maximum data amount and maximum time defined, is
missing, or is commented out, this is a finding.
Remediation:
Configure RHEL 9 to force a frequent session key renegotiation for SSH connections to
the server by adding or modifying the following line in the "/etc/ssh/sshd_config" or in a

Profile Applicability:

Description:
RHEL 9 must be configured so that all network connections associated with SSH traffic
terminate after becoming unresponsive.
GROUP ID: V-257995
RULE ID: SV-257995r1045053
Rationale:
Terminating an unresponsive SSH session within a short time period reduces the
window of opportunity for unauthorized personnel to take control of a management
session enabled on the console or console port that has been left unattended. In
addition, quickly terminating an idle SSH session will also free up resources committed
by the managed network element.
Terminating network connections associated with communications sessions includes,
for example, deallocating associated TCP/IP address/port pairs at the operating system
level and deallocating networking assignments at the application level if multiple
application sessions are using a single operating system-level network connection. This
does not mean the operating system terminates all sessions or network access; it only
ends the unresponsive session and releases the resources associated with that
session.
RHEL 9 utilizes /etc/ssh/sshd_config for configurations of OpenSSH. Within the
sshd_config, the product of the values of "ClientAliveInterval" and
"ClientAliveCountMax" are used to establish the inactivity threshold. The
"ClientAliveInterval" is a timeout interval in seconds, after which if no data has been
received from the client, sshd will send a message through the encrypted channel to
request a response from the client. The "ClientAliveCountMax" is the number of client
alive messages that may be sent without sshd receiving any messages back from the
client. If this threshold is met, sshd will disconnect the client. For more information on
these settings and others, refer to the sshd_config man pages.
Satisfies: SRG-OS-000163-GPOS-00072, SRG-OS-000279-GPOS-00109

ClientAliveCountMax 1
If "ClientAliveCountMax" does not exist, is not set to a value of "1" in

1.242 RHEL-09-271035 (Automated)
Profile Applicability:
•  SEVERITY: CAT II
Description:
RHEL 9 must prevent a user from overriding the disabling of the graphical user interface
autorun function.
GROUP ID: V-258017
RULE ID: SV-258017r1045088
Rationale:
Techniques used to address this include protocols using nonces (e.g., numbers
generated for a specific one-time use) or challenges (e.g., TLS, WS_Security).
Additional techniques include time-synchronous or challenge-response one-time
authenticators.
Satisfies: SRG-OS-000114-GPOS-00059, SRG-OS-000378-GPOS-00163, SRG-OS-
000480-GPOS-00227
Audit:
Note: This requirement assumes the use of the RHEL 9 default graphical user interface,
the GNOME desktop environment. If the system does not have any graphical user
interface installed, this requirement is Not Applicable.
Verify RHEL 9 disables ability of the user to override the graphical user interface
autorun setting.
Determine which profile the system database is using with the following command:
$ gsettings writable org.gnome.desktop.media-handling autorun-never
false
If "autorun-never" is writable, the result is "true". If this is not documented with the
information system security officer (ISSO) as an operational requirement, this is a
finding.
Remediation:
Configure the GNOME desktop to not allow a user to change the setting that disables
autorun on removable media.
Add the following line to "/etc/dconf/db/local.d/locks/00-security-settings-lock" to prevent
user modification:
/org/gnome/desktop/media-handling/autorun-never
Then update the dconf system databases:
$ sudo dconf update

Description:
RHEL 9 must not allow unattended or automatic logon via the graphical user interface.
GROUP ID: V-258018
RULE ID: SV-258018r1045090
Rationale:
Failure to restrict system access to authenticated users negatively impacts operating
system security.
Audit:
Note: This requirement assumes the use of the RHEL 9 default graphical user interface,
the GNOME desktop environment. If the system does not have any graphical user
interface installed, this requirement is Not Applicable.
Verify RHEL 9 does not allow an unattended or automatic logon to the system via a
graphical user interface.
Check for the value of the "AutomaticLoginEnable" in the "/etc/gdm/custom.conf" file
with the following command:
$  grep -i automaticlogin /etc/gdm/custom.conf
AutomaticLoginEnable=false
If the value of "AutomaticLoginEnable" is not set to "false", this is a finding.
Remediation:
Configure the GNOME desktop display manager to disable automatic login.
Set AutomaticLoginEnable to false in the [daemon] section in /etc/gdm/custom.conf. For
example:
[daemon]
AutomaticLoginEnable=false

Profile Applicability:
•  SEVERITY: CAT II
Description:
RHEL 9 must be able to initiate directly a session lock for all connection types using
smart card when the smart card is removed.
GROUP ID: V-258019
RULE ID: SV-258019r1045092
Rationale:
A session lock is a temporary action taken when a user stops work and moves away
from the immediate physical vicinity of the information system but does not want to log
out because of the temporary nature of the absence.
The session lock is implemented at the point where session activity can be determined.
Rather than be forced to wait for a period of time to expire before the user session can
be locked, RHEL 9 needs to provide users with the ability to manually invoke a session
lock so users can secure their session if it is necessary to temporarily vacate the
immediate physical vicinity.

Audit:
Note: This requirement assumes the use of the RHEL 9 default graphical user interface,
the GNOME desktop environment. If the system does not have any graphical user
interface installed, this requirement is Not Applicable.
Verify RHEL 9 enables a user's session lock until that user reestablishes access using
established identification and authentication procedures with the following command:
$ gsettings get org.gnome.settings-daemon.peripherals.smartcard removal-
action
'lock-screen'
If the result is not 'lock-screen', this is a finding.
Remediation:
Configure RHEL 9 to enable a user's session lock until that user re-establishes access
using established identification and authentication procedures.
Select or create an authselect profile and incorporate the "with-smartcard-lock-on-
removal" feature with the following example:
$ sudo authselect select sssd with-smartcard with-smartcard-lock-on-removal
Alternatively, the dconf settings can be edited in the /etc/dconf/db/* location.
Add or update the [org/gnome/settings-daemon/peripherals/smartcard] section of the
/etc/dconf/db/local.d/00-security-settings" database file and add or update the following
lines:
[org/gnome/settings-daemon/peripherals/smartcard]

Rationale:
A session lock is a temporary action taken when a user stops work and moves away

RHEL 9 must prevent a user from overriding the screensaver lock-enabled setting for
the graphical user interface.
GROUP ID: V-258022
RULE ID: SV-258022r1045097
Rationale:
A session time-out lock is a temporary action taken when a user stops work and moves
away from the immediate physical vicinity of the information system but does not log out
because of the temporary nature of the absence. Rather than relying on the user to
manually lock their operating system session prior to vacating the vicinity, operating
systems need to be able to identify when a user's session has idled and take action to
initiate the session lock.
The session lock is implemented at the point where session activity can be determined
and/or controlled.
Implementing session settings will have little value if a user is able to manipulate these
settings from the defaults prescribed in the other requirements of this implementation
guide.

Description:
RHEL 9 effective dconf policy must match the policy keyfiles.
GROUP ID: V-258028
RULE ID: SV-258028r991589
Rationale:
Unlike text-based keyfiles, the binary database is impossible to check through most
automated and all manual means; therefore, in order to evaluate dconf configuration,
both have to be true at the same time - configuration files have to be compliant, and the
database needs to be more recent than those keyfiles, which gives confidence that it
reflects them.
Audit:
Check the last modification time of the local databases, comparing it to the last
modification time of the related keyfiles. The following command will check every dconf
database and compare its modification time to the related system keyfiles:
Note: This requirement assumes the use of the RHEL 9 default graphical user interface,
the GNOME desktop environment. If the system does not have any graphical user
interface installed, this requirement is Not Applicable.

"$keyfile_mtime" ] && [ "$db_mtime" -lt "$keyfile_mtime" ]; then echo "$db
needs update"; return 1; fi; done; }; dconf_needs_update
If the command has any output, then a dconf database needs to be updated, and this is
a finding.

Description:
RHEL 9 must have the USBGuard package installed.
GROUP ID: V-258035
RULE ID: SV-258035r1045125
Rationale:
The USBguard-daemon is the main component of the USBGuard software framework. It
runs as a service in the background and enforces the USB device authorization policy
for all USB devices. The policy is defined by a set of rules using a rule language
described in the usbguard-rules.conf file. The policy and the authorization state of USB
devices can be modified during runtime using the usbguard tool.
The system administrator (SA) must work with the site information system security
officer (ISSO) to determine a list of authorized peripherals and establish rules within the
USBGuard software framework to allow only authorized devices.
Audit:
Verify USBGuard is installed on the operating system with the following command:
$ sudo dnf list installed usbguard
Example output:

If the USBGuard package is not installed, ask the SA to indicate how unauthorized
peripherals are being blocked.
If there is no evidence that unauthorized peripherals are being blocked before
establishing a connection, this is a finding.
If the system is virtual machine with no virtual or physical USB peripherals attached, this

Enable the service to start on boot and then start it with the following commands:
$ sudo systemctl enable usbguard
$ sudo systemctl start usbguard
Verify the status of the service with the following command:
$ sudo systemctl status usbguard
Note: usbguard will need to be configured to allow authorized devices once it is enabled

Description:
RHEL 9 must enable Linux audit logging for the USBGuard daemon.
GROUP ID: V-258037
RULE ID: SV-258037r1014863
Rationale:
Without the capability to generate audit records, it would be difficult to establish,
correlate, and investigate the events relating to an incident or identify those responsible
for one.
If auditing is enabled late in the startup process, the actions of some startup processes
may not be audited. Some audit systems also maintain state information only available
if auditing is enabled before a given process is created.
Audit records can be generated from various components within the information system
(e.g., module or policy filter).
The list of audited events is the set of events for which audits are to be generated. This
set of events is typically a subset of the list of all events for which the system is capable
of generating audit records.
DOD has defined the list of events for which RHEL 9 will provide an audit record
generation capability as the following:
1. Successful and unsuccessful attempts to access, modify, or delete privileges,
security objects, security levels, or categories of information (e.g., classification
levels);
2. Access actions, such as successful and unsuccessful logon attempts, privileged
activities or other system-level access, starting and ending time for user access
to the system, concurrent logons from different workstations, successful and
unsuccessful accesses to objects, all program initiations, and all direct access to
the information system;
3. All account creations, modifications, disabling, and terminations; and
4. All kernel module load, unload, and restart actions.
Audit:
To verify that Linux Audit logging is enabled for the USBGuard daemon with the
following command:
$ sudo grep AuditBackend /etc/usbguard/usbguard-daemon.conf
AuditBackend=LinuxAudit
If "AuditBackend" is not set to "LinuxAudit", this is a finding.
If the system is virtual machine with no virtual or physical USB peripherals attached, this
is not a finding.
Remediation:
Configure RHEL 9 USBGuard AuditBackend to use the audit system.

Description:
RHEL 9 user account passwords for new users or password changes must have a 60-
day maximum password lifetime restriction in /etc/login.defs.
GROUP ID: V-258041
RULE ID: SV-258041r1038967
Rationale:
Any password, no matter how complex, can eventually be cracked; therefore,
passwords need to be changed periodically. If the operating system does not limit the
lifetime of passwords and force users to change their passwords, there is the risk that
the operating system passwords could be compromised.
Setting the password maximum age ensures users are required to periodically change
their passwords. Requiring shorter password lifetimes increases the risk of users writing
down the password in a convenient location subject to physical compromise.
Audit:
Verify that RHEL 9 enforces a 60-day maximum password lifetime for new user
accounts by running the following command:
$ grep -i pass_max_days /etc/login.defs
PASS_MAX_DAYS 60
If the "PASS_MAX_DAYS" parameter value is greater than "60", or commented out, this
is a finding.
Remediation:
Configure RHEL 9 to enforce a 60-day maximum password lifetime.
Add or modify the following line in the "/etc/login.defs" file:
PASS_MAX_DAYS 60

Profile Applicability:

Description:
RHEL 9 must set the umask value to 077 for all local interactive user accounts.
GROUP ID: V-258044
RULE ID: SV-258044r1045135
Rationale:
The umask controls the default access mode assigned to newly created files. A umask
of 077 limits new files to mode 600 or less permissive. Although umask can be
represented as a four-digit number, the first digit representing special access modes is
typically ignored or required to be "0". This requirement applies to the globally
configured system defaults and the local interactive user defaults for each account on
the system.
Audit:
Verify that the default umask for all local interactive users is "077".
Identify the locations of all local interactive user home directories by looking at the
"/etc/passwd" file.
Check all local interactive user initialization files for interactive users with the following
command:
Note: The example is for a system that is configured to create users home directories in
the "/home" directory.
$ sudo find /home -maxdepth 2 -type f -name ".[^.]*" -exec grep -iH -d skip -
-exclude=.bash_history umask {} \;
/home/wadea/.bash_history:grep -i umask /etc/bashrc /etc/csh.cshrc
/etc/profile
/home/wadea/.bash_history:grep -i umask /etc/login.defs
If any local interactive user initialization files are found to have a umask statement that
sets a value less restrictive than "077", this is a finding.
Remediation:
Remove the umask statement from all local interactive user's initialization files.
If the account is for an application, the requirement for a umask less restrictive than
"077" can be documented with the information system security officer, but the user
agreement for access to the account must specify that the local interactive user must
log on to their account first and then switch the user to the application account with the
correct option to gain the account's environment variables.

GROUP ID: V-258046
RULE ID: SV-258046r991589
Rationale:
Ensuring shells are not given to system accounts upon login makes it more difficult for
attackers to make use of system accounts.
Audit:
Verify that system accounts must not have an interactive login shell with the following
command:
$ awk -F: '($3<1000){print $1 ":" $3 ":" $7}' /etc/passwd

Identify the system accounts from this listing that do not have a nologin shell.
If any system account (other than the root account) has a login shell and it is not
documented with the information system security officer (ISSO), this is a finding.
Remediation:
Configure RHEL 9 so that all noninteractive accounts on the system do not have an
interactive shell assigned to them.
If the system account needs a shell assigned for mission operations, document the
need with the information system security officer (ISSO).
Run the following command to disable the interactive shell for a specific noninteractive
user account:

Description:
RHEL 9 must automatically expire temporary accounts within 72 hours.
GROUP ID: V-258047
RULE ID: SV-258047r958508
Rationale:
Temporary accounts are privileged or nonprivileged accounts that are established
during pressing circumstances, such as new software or hardware configuration or an
incident response, where the need for prompt account activation requires bypassing
normal account authorization procedures. If any inactive temporary accounts are left
enabled on the system and are not either manually removed or automatically expired
within 72 hours, the security posture of the system will be degraded and exposed to
exploitation by unauthorized users or insider threat actors.
Temporary accounts are different from emergency accounts. Emergency accounts, also
known as "last resort" or "break glass" accounts, are local logon accounts enabled on
the system for emergency use by authorized system administrators to manage a system
when standard logon methods are failing or not available. Emergency accounts are not
subject to manual removal or scheduled expiration requirements.
The automatic expiration of temporary accounts may be extended as needed by the
circumstances but it must not be extended indefinitely. A documented permanent
account should be established for privileged users who need long-term maintenance
accounts.
Satisfies: SRG-OS-000123-GPOS-00064, SRG-OS-000002-GPOS-00002
Audit:
Verify temporary accounts have been provisioned with an expiration date of 72 hours.
For every existing temporary account, run the following command to obtain its account
expiration information:
$ sudo chage -l <temporary_account_name> | grep -i "account expires"
Verify each of these accounts has an expiration date set within 72 hours.
If any temporary accounts have no expiration date set or do not expire within 72 hours,
this is a finding.
Remediation:
Configure the operating system to expire temporary accounts after 72 hours with the
following command:
$ sudo chage -E $(date -d +3days +%Y-%m-%d) <temporary_account_name>

unintended rights to any files associated with the group.
Audit:
Verify that all RHEL 9 interactive users have a valid GID.

35 days of inactivity.
GROUP ID: V-258049
RULE ID: SV-258049r1015092
Rationale:
Inactive identifiers pose a risk to systems and applications because attackers may
exploit an inactive identifier and potentially obtain undetected access to the system.
Disabling inactive accounts ensures that accounts which may not have been
responsibly removed are not available to attackers who may have compromised their
credentials.
Owners of inactive accounts will not notice if unauthorized access to their user account
has been obtained.
Audit:
Verify that RHEL 9 account identifiers (individuals, groups, roles, and devices) are
disabled after 35 days of inactivity with the following command:
Check the account inactivity value by performing the following command:
$ sudo grep -i inactive /etc/default/useradd
INACTIVE=35
If "INACTIVE" is set to "-1", a value greater than "35", or is commented out, this is a
finding.
Remediation:
Configure RHEL 9 to disable account identifiers after 35 days of inactivity after the
password expiration.
Run the following command to change the configuration for useradd:

Description:
Executable search paths within the initialization files of all local interactive RHEL 9
users must only contain paths that resolve to the system default or the users home
directory.
GROUP ID: V-258050
RULE ID: SV-258050r1045137
Rationale:
The executable search path (typically the PATH environment variable) contains a list of
directories for the shell to search to find executables. If this path includes the current
working directory (other than the users home directory), executables in these directories
may be executed instead of system commands.
This variable is formatted as a colon-separated list of directories. If there is an empty
entry, such as a leading or trailing colon or two consecutive colons, this is interpreted as
the current working directory. If deviations from the default system search path for the
local interactive user are required, they must be documented with the information
system security officer (ISSO).
Audit:
Verify that all local interactive user initialization file executable search path statements
do not contain statements that will reference a working directory other than user home
directories with the following commands:
$ sudo find /home -maxdepth 2 -type f -name ".[^.]*" -exec grep -iH path= {}
\;
PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$HOME/bin:$PATH"
If any local interactive user initialization files have executable search path statements
that include directories outside of their home directory, and this is not documented with
the ISSO as an operational requirement, this is a finding.
Remediation:
Edit the local interactive user initialization files to change any PATH variable statements
that reference directories other than their home directory.
If a local interactive user requires path variables to reference a directory owned by the
application, it must be documented with the ISSO.

GROUP ID: V-258052
RULE ID: SV-258052r991589
Rationale:
If a local interactive user has a home directory defined that does not exist, the user may
be given access to the / directory as the current working directory upon logon. This
could create a denial of service because the user would not be able to access their
logon configuration files, and it may give them visibility to system files they normally
would not be able to access.
Audit:
Verify the assigned home directories of all interactive users on the system exist with the

The output should not return any interactive users.
If users home directory does not exist, this is a finding.

Rationale:
If the Group Identifier (GID) of a local interactive users home directory is not the same

Audit:
Verify the assigned home directory of all local interactive users is group-owned by that
user's primary GID with the following command:
Note: This may miss local interactive users that have been assigned a privileged user
identifier (UID). Evidence of interactive use may be obtained from a number of log files
containing system logon information. The returned directory "/home/wadea" is used as
an example.

Description:
RHEL 9 must not have unauthorized accounts.
GROUP ID: V-258058
RULE ID: SV-258058r1045148
Rationale:
Accounts providing no operational purpose provide additional opportunities for system
compromise. Unnecessary accounts include user accounts for individuals not requiring
access to the system and application accounts for applications not installed on the
system.
Audit:
Verify that there are no unauthorized interactive user accounts with the following
command:
$ less /etc/passwd
root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
...
games:x:12:100:games:/usr/games:/sbin/nologin
scsaustin:x:1001:1001:scsaustin:/home/scsaustin:/bin/bash
djohnson:x:1002:1002:djohnson:/home/djohnson:/bin/bash
Interactive user accounts generally will have a user identifier (UID) of 1000 or greater, a
home directory in a specific partition, and an interactive shell.
Obtain the list of interactive user accounts authorized to be on the system from the
system administrator or information system security officer (ISSO) and compare it to the
list of local interactive user accounts on the system.
If there are unauthorized local user accounts on the system, this is a finding.

Description:
The root account must be the only account having unrestricted access to RHEL 9
system.
GROUP ID: V-258059
RULE ID: SV-258059r991589
Rationale:
An account has root authority if it has a user identifier (UID) of "0". Multiple accounts
with a UID of "0" afford more opportunity for potential intruders to guess a password for
a privileged account. Proper configuration of sudo is recommended to afford multiple
system administrators access to root privileges in an accountable manner.
Audit:
Verify that only the "root" account has a UID "0" assignment with the following
command:
$ awk -F: '$3 == 0 {print $1}' /etc/passwd
root
If any accounts other than "root" have a UID of "0", this is a finding.
Remediation:
Change the UID of any account on the system, other than root, that has a UID of "0".
If the account is associated with system commands or applications, the UID should be
changed to one greater than "0" but less than "1000". Otherwise, assign a UID of
greater than "1000" that has not already been assigned.

Rationale:
Having lockouts persist across reboots ensures that account is only unlocked by an

GROUP ID: V-258062
RULE ID: SV-258062r991589
Rationale:
If user start-up files execute world-writable programs, especially in unprotected
directories, they could be maliciously modified to destroy user files or otherwise
compromise the system at the user level. If the system is compromised at the user
level, it is easier to elevate privileges to eventually compromise the system at the root
and network level.
Audit:
Verify that local initialization files do not execute world-writable programs with the
following command:
Note: The example will be for a system that is configured to create user home
directories in the "/home" directory.
$ sudo find /home -perm -002 -type f -name ".[^.]*" -exec ls -ld {} \;

RHEL 9 must limit the number of concurrent sessions to ten for all accounts and/or
account types.
GROUP ID: V-258069
RULE ID: SV-258069r958398
Rationale:
Operating system management includes the ability to control the number of users and
user sessions that utilize an operating system. Limiting the number of allowed users and
sessions per user is helpful in reducing the risks related to denial-of-service (DoS)
attacks.
This requirement addresses concurrent sessions for information system accounts and
does not address concurrent sessions by single users via multiple system accounts.
The maximum number of concurrent sessions must be defined based on mission needs
and the operational environment for each system.
Audit:
Verify RHEL 9 limits the number of concurrent sessions to "10" for all accounts and/or
account types with the following command:
$ grep -r -s maxlogins /etc/security/limits.conf
/etc/security/limits.d/*.conf
/etc/security/limits.conf:* hard maxlogins 10
This can be set as a global domain (with the * wildcard) but may be set differently for
multiple domains.
If the "maxlogins" item is missing, commented out, or the value is set greater than "10"
and is not documented with the information system security officer (ISSO) as an
operational requirement for all domains that have the "maxlogins" item assigned, this is
a finding.
Remediation:
Configure RHEL 9 to limit the number of concurrent sessions to "10" for all accounts

GROUP ID: V-258074
RULE ID: SV-258074r991590
Rationale:
Setting the most restrictive default permissions ensures that when new accounts are
created, they do not have unnecessary access.
Audit:
Verify RHEL 9 defines default permissions for all authenticated users in such a way that
the user can only read and modify their own files with the following command:
Note: If the value of the "UMASK" parameter is set to "000" in "/etc/login.defs" file, the
Severity is raised to a CAT I.
# grep -i umask /etc/login.defs
UMASK 077
If the value for the "UMASK" parameter is not "077", or the "UMASK" parameter is
missing or is commented out, this is a finding.
Remediation:
Configure RHEL 9 to define default permissions for all authenticated users in such a
way that the user can only read and modify their own files.
Add or edit the lines for the "UMASK" parameter in the "/etc/login.defs" file to "077":

Description:
RHEL 9 must define default permissions for the system default profile.
GROUP ID: V-258075
RULE ID: SV-258075r991590
Rationale:
The umask controls the default access mode assigned to newly created files. A umask
of 077 limits new files to mode 600 or less permissive. Although umask can be
represented as a four-digit number, the first digit representing special access modes is
typically ignored or required to be "0". This requirement applies to the globally
configured system defaults and the local interactive user defaults for each account on
the system.

Audit:
Verify the "umask" setting is configured correctly in the "/etc/profile" file with the
following command:
Note: If the value of the "umask" parameter is set to "000" "/etc/profile" file, the Severity

Description:
RHEL 9 must display the date and time of the last successful account logon upon logon.
GROUP ID: V-258076
RULE ID: SV-258076r991589
Rationale:
Users need to be aware of activity that occurs regarding their account. Providing users
with information regarding the number of unsuccessful attempts that were made to login
to their account allows the user to determine if any unauthorized activity has occurred
and gives them an opportunity to notify administrators.
Audit:
Verify users are provided with feedback on when account accesses last occurred with
the following command:
$ sudo grep pam_lastlog /etc/pam.d/postlogin
session required pam_lastlog.so showfailed
If "pam_lastlog" is missing from "/etc/pam.d/postlogin" file, or the silent option is present,
this is a finding.
Remediation:
Configure RHEL 9 to provide users with feedback on when account accesses last
occurred by setting the required configuration options in "/etc/pam.d/postlogin".

Rationale:
Terminating an idle session within a short time period reduces the window of
opportunity for unauthorized personnel to take control of a management session
enabled on the console or console port that has been left unattended.
Audit:
Verify that RHEL 9 logs out sessions that are idle for 15 minutes with the following

Description:
RHEL 9 must use a Linux Security Module configured to enforce limits on system
services.
GROUP ID: V-258078
RULE ID: SV-258078r958944
Rationale:
Without verification of the security functions, security functions may not operate
correctly and the failure may go unnoticed. Security function is defined as the hardware,
software, and/or firmware of the information system responsible for enforcing the
system security policy and supporting the isolation of code and data on which the
protection is based. Security functionality includes, but is not limited to, establishing
system accounts, configuring access authorizations (i.e., permissions, privileges),
setting events to be audited, and setting intrusion detection parameters.
This requirement applies to operating systems performing security function
verification/testing and/or systems and environments that require this functionality.
Satisfies: SRG-OS-000445-GPOS-00199, SRG-OS-000134-GPOS-00068
Audit:
Ensure that RHEL 9 verifies correct operation of security functions through the use of
SELinux with the following command:
$ getenforce
Enforcing
If SELINUX is not set to "Enforcing", this is a finding.
Verify that SELinux is configured to be enforcing at boot.
grep "SELINUX=" /etc/selinux/config
# SELINUX= can take one of these three values:
# NOTE: In earlier Fedora kernel builds, SELINUX=disabled would also
SELINUX=enforcing
If SELINUX line is missing, commented out, or not set to "enforcing", this is a finding.
Remediation:
Configure RHEL 9 to verify correct operation of security functions.
Edit the file "/etc/selinux/config" and add or modify the following line:

Description:
RHEL 9 must enable the SELinux targeted policy.
GROUP ID: V-258079
RULE ID: SV-258079r1045159
Rationale:
Setting the SELinux policy to "targeted" or a more specialized policy ensures the system
will confine processes that are likely to be targeted for exploitation, such as network or
system services.
Note: During the development or debugging of SELinux modules, it is common to
temporarily place nonproduction systems in "permissive" mode. In such temporary
cases, SELinux policies should be developed, and once work is completed, the system
should be reconfigured to "targeted".
Audit:
Verify the SELINUX on RHEL 9 is using the targeted policy with the following command:
$ sestatus | grep "policy name"
Loaded policy name:             targeted
If the loaded policy name is not "targeted", this is a finding.
Remediation:
Configure RHEL 9 to use the targetd SELINUX policy.
Edit the file "/etc/selinux/config" and add or modify the following line:

Description:
RHEL 9 must elevate the SELinux context when an administrator calls the sudo
command.
GROUP ID: V-272496
RULE ID: SV-272496r1082184
Rationale:
Without verification of the security functions, security functions may not operate
correctly and the failure may go unnoticed. Security function is defined as the hardware,
software, and/or firmware of the information system responsible for enforcing the
system security policy and supporting the isolation of code and data on which the
protection is based. Security functionality includes, but is not limited to, establishing
system accounts, configuring access authorizations (i.e., permissions, privileges),
setting events to be audited, and setting intrusion detection parameters.
This requirement applies to operating systems performing security function
verification/testing and/or systems and environments that require this functionality.
Preventing nonprivileged users from executing privileged functions mitigates the risk
that unauthorized individuals or processes may gain unnecessary access to information
or privileges.
Privileged functions include, for example, establishing accounts, performing system
integrity checks, or administering cryptographic key management activities.
Nonprivileged users are individuals who do not possess appropriate authorizations.
Circumventing intrusion detection and prevention mechanisms or malicious code
protection mechanisms are examples of privileged functions that require protection from
nonprivileged users.
Audit:
Verify that RHEL 9 elevates the SELinux context when an administrator calls the sudo
command with the following command:
This command must be run as root:
# grep -r sysadm_r /etc/sudoers /etc/sudoers.d
%{designated_group_or_user_name} ALL=(ALL) TYPE=sysadm_t ROLE=sysadm_r ALL
If conflicting results are returned, this is a finding.
If a designated sudoers administrator group or account(s) is not configured to elevate
the SELinux type and role to "sysadm_t" and "sysadm_r" with the use of the sudo
command, this is a finding.
Remediation:
Configure RHEL 9 to elevate the SELinux context when an administrator calls the sudo
command.
Edit a file in the "/etc/sudoers.d" directory with the following command:
$ sudo visudo -f /etc/sudoers.d/<customfile>
Use the following example to build the in the /etc/sudoers.d directory to allow any
administrator belonging to a designated sudoers admin group to elevate their SELinux
context with the use of the sudo command:
%{designated_group_or_user_name} ALL=(ALL) TYPE=sysadm_t ROLE=sysadm_r ALL
Remove any configurations that conflict with the above from the following locations:
/etc/sudoers
/etc/sudoers.d/

GROUP ID: V-258080
RULE ID: SV-258080r1045162
Rationale:
Not having the correct SELinux context on the faillock directory may lead to
unauthorized access to the directory.
Audit:
Verify the location of the nondefault tally directory for the pam_faillock module with the
following command:
Note: If the system does not have SELinux enabled and enforcing a targeted policy, or if
the pam_faillock module is not configured for use, this requirement is Not Applicable.
$ sudo grep -w dir /etc/security/faillock.conf
dir = /var/log/faillock
Check the security context type of the nondefault tally directory with the following
command:
$ ls -Zd /var/log/faillock
unconfined_u:object_r:faillog_t:s0 /var/log/faillock
If the security context type of the nondefault tally directory is not "faillog_t", this is a
finding.
Remediation:
Configure RHEL 9 to allow the use of a nondefault faillock tally directory while SELinux
enforces a targeted policy.
First enable the feature using the following command:
$ sudo authselect enable-feature with-faillock
Create a nondefault faillock tally directory (if it does not already exist) with the following
example:
$ sudo mkdir /var/log/faillock
Then add/modify the "/etc/security/faillock.conf" file to match the following line:
dir = /var/log/faillock
Update the /etc/selinux/targeted/contexts/files/file_contexts.local with "faillog_t" context
type for the nondefault faillock tally directory with the following command:
$ sudo semanage fcontext -a -t faillog_t "/var/log/faillock(/.*)?"

When operating systems provide the capability to escalate a functional capability, it is
critical the organization requires the user to reauthenticate when using the "sudo"
command.
If the value is set to an integer less than "0", the user's time stamp will not expire and

Description:
RHEL 9 fapolicy module must be installed.
GROUP ID: V-258089
RULE ID: SV-258089r1045179
Rationale:
The organization must identify authorized software programs and permit execution of
authorized software. The process used to identify software programs that are authorized
to execute on organizational information systems is commonly referred to as allow
listing.
Utilizing an allow list provides a configuration management method for allowing the
execution of only authorized software. Using only authorized software decreases risk by
limiting the number of potential vulnerabilities. Verification of allow listed software
occurs prior to execution or at system startup.
User home directories/folders may contain information of a sensitive nature.
Nonprivileged users should coordinate any sharing of information with an SA through
shared resources.
RHEL 9 ships with many optional packages. One such package is a file access policy
daemon called "fapolicyd". "fapolicyd" is a userspace daemon that determines access
rights to files based on attributes of the process and file. It can be used to either
blocklist or allow list processes or file access.
Proceed with caution with enforcing the use of this daemon. Improper configuration may
render the system nonfunctional. The "fapolicyd" API is not namespace aware and can
cause issues when launching or running containers.

Description:
RHEL 9 must ensure the password complexity module in the system-auth file is
configured for three retries or less.
GROUP ID: V-258091
RULE ID: SV-258091r1045185
Rationale:
Use of a complex password helps to increase the time and resources required to
compromise the password. Password complexity, or strength, is a measure of the
effectiveness of a password in resisting attempts at guessing and brute-force attacks.
"pwquality" enforces complex password construction configuration and has the ability to
limit brute-force attacks on the system.
RHEL 9 uses "pwquality" as a mechanism to enforce password complexity. This is set
in both: /etc/pam.d/password-auth /etc/pam.d/system-auth
By limiting the number of attempts to meet the pwquality module complexity
requirements before returning with an error, the system will audit abnormal attempts at
password changes.
Audit:
Verify RHEL 9 is configured to limit the "pwquality" retry option to "3".
Check for the use of the retry option in the security directory with the following
command:
$ grep -w retry /etc/security/pwquality.conf
/etc/security/pwquality.conf.d/*.conf
retry = 3
If the value of "retry" is set to "0" or greater than "3", or is missing, this is a finding.
Remediation:
Configure RHEL 9 to limit the "pwquality" retry option to "3".
Add or update the following line in the "/etc/security/pwquality.conf" file or a file in the
"/etc/security/pwquality.conf.d/" directory to contain the "retry" parameter:

password lifetime restriction in /etc/login.defs.
GROUP ID: V-258104
RULE ID: SV-258104r1015104
Rationale:
Enforcing a minimum password lifetime helps to prevent repeated password changes to
defeat the password reuse or history enforcement requirement. If users are allowed to
immediately and continually change their password, then the password could be
repeatedly changed in a short period of time to defeat the organization's policy

Description:
RHEL 9 passwords must be created with a minimum of 15 characters.
GROUP ID: V-258107
RULE ID: SV-258107r1045218
Rationale:
The shorter the password, the lower the number of possible combinations that need to
be tested before the password is compromised.
Password complexity, or strength, is a measure of the effectiveness of a password in
resisting attempts at guessing and brute-force attacks. Password length is one factor of
several that helps to determine strength and how long it takes to crack a password. Use
of more characters in a password helps to increase exponentially the time and/or
resources required to compromise the password.
RHEL 9 uses "pwquality" as a mechanism to enforce password complexity.
Configurations are set in the "etc/security/pwquality.conf" file.
The "minlen", sometimes noted as minimum length, acts as a "score" of complexity
based on the credit components of the "pwquality" module. By setting the credit
components to a negative value, not only will those components be required, but they
will not count toward the total "score" of "minlen". This will enable "minlen" to require a
15-character minimum.
The DOD minimum password requirement is 15 characters.
Audit:
Verify that RHEL 9 enforces a minimum 15-character password length with the following
command:
$ grep minlen /etc/security/pwquality.conf
/etc/security/pwquality.conf.d/*.conf
minlen = 15
If the command does not return a "minlen" value of "15" or greater, does not return a
line, or the line is commented out, this is a finding.
Remediation:
Configure RHEL 9 to enforce a minimum 15-character password length.
Add or update the following line in the "/etc/security/pwquality.conf" file or a

1.334 RHEL-09-611130 (Automated)
Profile Applicability:
•  SEVERITY: CAT II
Description:
RHEL 9 must require the change of at least four character classes when passwords are
changed.
GROUP ID: V-258115
RULE ID: SV-258115r1045238
Rationale:
Use of a complex password helps to increase the time and resources required to
compromise the password. Password complexity, or strength, is a measure of the
effectiveness of a password in resisting attempts at guessing and brute-force attacks.
Password complexity is one factor of several that determines how long it takes to crack
a password. The more complex a password, the greater the number of possible
combinations that need to be tested before the password is compromised.
Audit:
Verify that RHEL 9 requires passwords to contain at least four character classes.
$ grep minclass /etc/security/pwquality.conf
/etc/security/pwquality.conf.d/*.conf
minclass = 4
If the value of "minclass" is set to less than "4", or is commented out, this is a finding.
Remediation:
Configure RHEL 9 to require the change of at least four character classes when
passwords are changed by setting the "minclass" option.
Add or update the following line in the "/etc/security/pwquality.conf" file or a
configuration file in the "/etc/security/pwquality.conf.d/" directory to contain the
"minclass" parameter:
minclass = 4

Description:
RHEL 9 must be configured so that user and group account administration utilities are
configured to store only encrypted representations of passwords.
GROUP ID: V-258116
RULE ID: SV-258116r1045240
Rationale:
Passwords need to be protected at all times, and encryption is the standard method for
protecting passwords. If passwords are not encrypted, they can be plainly read (i.e.,
clear text) and easily compromised. Passwords that are encrypted with a weak
algorithm are no more protected than if they are kept in plain text.
This setting ensures user and group account administration utilities are configured to
store only encrypted representations of passwords. Additionally, the "crypt_style"
configuration option ensures the use of a strong hashing algorithm that makes
password cracking attacks more difficult.
Audit:
Verify the user and group account administration utilities are configured to store only
encrypted representations of passwords with the following command:
$ grep crypt_style /etc/libuser.conf
crypt_style = sha512
If the "crypt_style" variable is not set to "sha512", is not in the defaults section, is
commented out, or does not exist, this is a finding.
Remediation:
Configure RHEL 9 to use the SHA-512 algorithm for password hashing.
Add or change the following line in the "[defaults]" section of "/etc/libuser.conf" file:
crypt_style = sha512

Description:
RHEL 9 must use the common access card (CAC) smart card driver.
GROUP ID: V-258121
RULE ID: SV-258121r1045243
Rationale:
Smart card login provides two-factor authentication stronger than that provided by a
username and password combination. Smart cards leverage public key infrastructure to
provide and verify credentials. Configuring the smart card driver in use by the
organization helps to prevent users from using unauthorized smart cards.

Description:
RHEL 9 must enable certificate based smart card authentication.
GROUP ID: V-258122
RULE ID: SV-258122r1045246
Rationale:
Without the use of multifactor authentication, the ease of access to privileged functions
is greatly increased. Multifactor authentication requires using two or more factors to
achieve authentication. A privileged account is defined as an information system
account with authorizations of a privileged user. The DOD Common Access Card (CAC)
with DOD-approved PKI is an example of multifactor authentication.
Satisfies: SRG-OS-000375-GPOS-00160, SRG-OS-000105-GPOS-00052
Audit:
Note: If the system administrator (SA) demonstrates the use of an approved alternate
multifactor authentication method, this requirement is Not Applicable.
To verify that RHEL 9 has smart cards enabled in System Security Services Daemon

$ sudo grep -ir pam_cert_auth /etc/sssd/sssd.conf /etc/sssd/conf.d/
pam_cert_auth = True
If "pam_cert_auth" is not set to "True", the line is commented out, or the line is missing,
this is a finding.

Description:
RHEL 9 must implement certificate status checking for multifactor authentication.
GROUP ID: V-258123
RULE ID: SV-258123r1045248
Rationale:
Using an authentication device, such as a DOD common access card (CAC) or token
that is separate from the information system, ensures that even if the information
system is compromised, credentials stored on the authentication device will not be
affected.
Multifactor solutions that require devices separate from information systems gaining
access include, for example, hardware tokens providing time-based or challenge-
response authenticators and smart cards such as the U.S. Government Personal
Identity Verification (PIV) card and the DOD CAC.
RHEL 9 includes multiple options for configuring certificate status checking, but for this
requirement focuses on the System Security Services Daemon (SSSD). By default,
SSSD performs Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) checking and certificate
verification using a sha256 digest function.
Satisfies: SRG-OS-000375-GPOS-00160, SRG-OS-000377-GPOS-00162
Audit:
Note: If the system administrator (SA) demonstrates the use of an approved alternate
multifactor authentication method, this requirement is Not Applicable.
Verify the operating system implements Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) and
is using the proper digest value on the system with the following command:
$ sudo grep -ir certificate_verification /etc/sssd/sssd.conf
/etc/sssd/conf.d/ | grep -v "^#"
certificate_verification = ocsp_dgst=sha512
If the certificate_verification line is missing from the [sssd] section, or is missing
"ocsp_dgst=sha512", ask the administrator to indicate what type of multifactor
authentication is being used and how the system implements certificate status checking.
If there is no evidence of certificate status checking being used, this is a finding.
Remediation:
Configure RHEL 9 to implement certificate status checking for multifactor authentication.
Review the "/etc/sssd/conf.d/certificate_verification.conf" file to determine if the system
is configured to prevent OCSP or certificate verification.
Add the following line to the "/etc/sssd/conf.d/certificate_verification.conf" file:
certificate_verification = ocsp_dgst=sha512
Set the correct ownership and permissions on the
"/etc/sssd/conf.d/certificate_verification.conf" file by running these commands:
$ sudo chown root:root "/etc/sssd/conf.d/certificate_verification.conf"
$ sudo chmod 600 "/etc/sssd/conf.d/certificate_verification.conf"

Description:
RHEL 9, for PKI-based authentication, must enforce authorized access to the
corresponding private key.
GROUP ID: V-258127
RULE ID: SV-258127r958450
Rationale:
If the private key is discovered, an attacker can use the key to authenticate as an
authorized user and gain access to the network infrastructure.
The cornerstone of the PKI is the private key used to encrypt or digitally sign
information.
If the private key is stolen, this will lead to the compromise of the authentication and
nonrepudiation gained through PKI because the attacker can use the private key to
digitally sign documents and pretend to be the authorized user.
Both the holders of a digital certificate and the issuing authority must protect the
computers, storage devices, or whatever they use to keep the private keys.
Audit:
Verify the SSH private key files have a passcode.
For each private key stored on the system, use the following command:
$ sudo ssh-keygen -y -f /path/to/file
If the contents of the key are displayed, this is a finding.

Description:
RHEL 9 must require authentication to access emergency mode.
GROUP ID: V-258128
RULE ID: SV-258128r958472
Rationale:
To mitigate the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive information by entities that have
been issued certificates by DOD-approved PKIs, all DOD systems (e.g., web servers
and web portals) must be properly configured to incorporate access control methods
that do not rely solely on the possession of a certificate for access. Successful
authentication must not automatically give an entity access to an asset or security
boundary. Authorization procedures and controls must be implemented to ensure each
authenticated entity also has a validated and current authorization. Authorization is the
process of determining whether an entity, once authenticated, is permitted to access a
specific asset. Information systems use access control policies and enforcement
mechanisms to implement this requirement.
This requirement prevents attackers with physical access from trivially bypassing
security on the machine and gaining root access. Such accesses are further prevented
by configuring the bootloader password.
Audit:
Verify that RHEL 9 requires authentication for emergency mode with the following
command:
$ grep sulogin /usr/lib/systemd/system/emergency.service
ExecStart=-/usr/lib/systemd/systemd-sulogin-shell emergency
If this line is not returned, or is commented out, this is a finding. If the output is different,
this is a finding.

Description:
RHEL 9 must require authentication to access single-user mode.
GROUP ID: V-258129
RULE ID: SV-258129r958472
Rationale:
To mitigate the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive information by entities that have
been issued certificates by DOD-approved PKIs, all DOD systems (e.g., web servers
and web portals) must be properly configured to incorporate access control methods
that do not rely solely on the possession of a certificate for access. Successful
authentication must not automatically give an entity access to an asset or security
boundary. Authorization procedures and controls must be implemented to ensure each
authenticated entity also has a validated and current authorization. Authorization is the
process of determining whether an entity, once authenticated, is permitted to access a
specific asset. Information systems use access control policies and enforcement
mechanisms to implement this requirement.
This requirement prevents attackers with physical access from trivially bypassing
security on the machine and gaining root access. Such accesses are further prevented
by configuring the bootloader password.
Audit:
Verify that RHEL 9 requires authentication for single-user mode with the following
command:
$ grep sulogin /usr/lib/systemd/system/rescue.service
ExecStart=-/usr/lib/systemd/systemd-sulogin-shell rescue

1.348 RHEL-09-631010 (Manual)
Profile Applicability:
•  SEVERITY: CAT II
Description:
RHEL 9, for PKI-based authentication, must validate certificates by constructing a
certification path (which includes status information) to an accepted trust anchor.
GROUP ID: V-258131
RULE ID: SV-258131r1015125
Rationale:
Without path validation, an informed trust decision by the relying party cannot be made
when presented with any certificate not already explicitly trusted.
A trust anchor is an authoritative entity represented via a public key and associated
data. It is used in the context of public key infrastructures, X.509 digital certificates, and
DNSSEC.
When there is a chain of trust, usually the top entity to be trusted becomes the trust
anchor; it can be, for example, a certification authority (CA). A certification path starts
with the subject certificate and proceeds through a number of intermediate certificates
up to a trusted root certificate, typically issued by a trusted CA.
This requirement verifies that a certification path to an accepted trust anchor is used for
certificate validation and that the path includes status information. Path validation is
necessary for a relying party to make an informed trust decision when presented with
any certificate not already explicitly trusted. Status information for certification paths
includes certificate revocation lists or online certificate status protocol responses.
Validation of the certificate status information is out of scope for this requirement.
Satisfies: SRG-OS-000066-GPOS-00034, SRG-OS-000384-GPOS-00167
Audit:
Verify RHEL 9 for PKI-based authentication has valid certificates by constructing a
certification path (which includes status information) to an accepted trust anchor.
Check that the system has a valid DOD root CA installed with the following command:
$ sudo openssl x509 -text -in /etc/sssd/pki/sssd_auth_ca_db.pem
Example output:
Certificate:
Data:
Version: 3 (0x2)

If the root CA file is not a DOD-issued certificate with a valid date and installed in the
"/etc/sssd/pki/sssd_auth_ca_db.pem" location, this is a finding.
Remediation:
Configure RHEL 9, for PKI-based authentication, to validate certificates by constructing
a certification path (which includes status information) to an accepted trust anchor.
Obtain a valid copy of the DOD root CA file from the PKI CA certificate bundle from
cyber.mil and copy the DoD_PKE_CA_chain.pem into the following file:

RHEL 9 must map the authenticated identity to the user or group account for PKI-based
authentication.
GROUP ID: V-258132
RULE ID: SV-258132r1045260
Rationale:
Without mapping the certificate used to authenticate to the user account, the ability to
determine the identity of the individual user or group will not be available for forensic
analysis.
Audit:
Verify the certificate of the user or group is mapped to the corresponding user or group
in the "sssd.conf" file with the following command:
$ sudo find /etc/sssd/sssd.conf /etc/sssd/conf.d/ -type f -exec cat {} \;

matchrule =<SAN>.*EDIPI@mil
maprule = (userCertificate;binary={cert!bin})
domains = testing.test
If the certmap section does not exist, ask the system administrator (SA) to indicate how
certificates are mapped to accounts.
If there is no evidence of certificate mapping, this is a finding.
Remediation:
Configure RHEL 9 to map the authenticated identity to the user or group account by
adding or modifying the certmap section of the "/etc/sssd/sssd.conf" file based on the
following example:
[certmap/testing.test/rule_name]
matchrule = .*EDIPI@mil
maprule = (userCertificate;binary={cert!bin})

Description:
RHEL 9 must prohibit the use of cached authenticators after one day.
GROUP ID: V-258133
RULE ID: SV-258133r1045263
Rationale:
If cached authentication information is out-of-date, the validity of the authentication
information may be questionable.
Audit:
Verify that the System Security Services Daemon (SSSD) prohibits the use of cached
authentications after one day.
Note: Cached authentication settings should be configured even if smart card
authentication is not used on the system.
Check that SSSD allows cached authentications with the following command:
$ sudo grep -ir cache_credentials /etc/sssd/sssd.conf /etc/sssd/conf.d/
cache_credentials = true
If "cache_credentials" is set to "false" or missing from the configuration file, this is not a
finding and no further checks are required.
If "cache_credentials" is set to "true", check that SSSD prohibits the use of cached
authentications after one day with the following command:
$ sudo grep -ir offline_credentials_expiration /etc/sssd/sssd.conf
/etc/sssd/conf.d/
offline_credentials_expiration = 1
If "offline_credentials_expiration" is not set to a value of "1", this is a finding.
Remediation:
Configure the SSSD to prohibit the use of cached authentications after one day.

RHEL 9 must have the AIDE package installed.
GROUP ID: V-258134
RULE ID: SV-258134r1045265
Rationale:
Without verification of the security functions, security functions may not operate
correctly, and the failure may go unnoticed. Security function is defined as the
hardware, software, and/or firmware of the information system responsible for enforcing
the system security policy and supporting the isolation of code and data on which the
protection is based. Security functionality includes, but is not limited to, establishing
system accounts, configuring access authorizations (i.e., permissions, privileges),
setting events to be audited, and setting intrusion detection parameters.
Satisfies: SRG-OS-000363-GPOS-00150, SRG-OS-000445-GPOS-00199
Audit:

installed with the following command:
$ dnf list --installed aide
Example output:

If AIDE is not installed, ask the system administrator (SA) how file integrity checks are
performed on the system.
If there is no application installed to perform integrity checks, this is a finding.
If AIDE is installed, check if it has been initialized with the following command:
$ sudo /usr/sbin/aide --check
If the output is "Couldn't open file /var/lib/aide/aide.db.gz for reading", this is a finding.
Remediation:
Install AIDE, initialize it, and perform a manual check.

Profile Applicability:
•  SEVERITY: CAT II
Description:
RHEL 9 must routinely check the baseline configuration for unauthorized changes and
notify the system administrator when anomalies in the operation of any security
functions are discovered.
GROUP ID: V-258135
RULE ID: SV-258135r1045267
Rationale:
Unauthorized changes to the baseline configuration could make the system vulnerable
to various attacks or allow unauthorized access to the operating system. Changes to
operating system configurations can have unintended side effects, some of which may
be relevant to security.
Detecting such changes and providing an automated response can help avoid
unintended, negative consequences that could ultimately affect the security state of the
operating system. The operating system's information management officer
(IMO)/information system security officer (ISSO) and system administrators (SAs) must
be notified via email and/or monitoring system trap when there is an unauthorized
modification of a configuration item.
Notifications provided by information systems include messages to local computer
consoles, and/or hardware indications, such as lights.
This capability must take into account operational requirements for availability for
selecting an appropriate response. The organization may choose to shut down or restart
the information system upon security function anomaly detection.

000447-GPOS-00201
Audit:
Verify that RHEL 9 routinely executes a file integrity scan for changes to the system
baseline. The command used in the example will use a daily occurrence.
Check the cron directories for scripts controlling the execution and notification of results
of the file integrity application. For example, if AIDE is installed on the system, use the
following commands:
$ sudo ls -al /etc/cron.* | grep aide
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 29 Nov 22 2015 aide
$ sudo grep aide /etc/crontab /var/spool/cron/root
/etc/crontab: 30 04 * * * root usr/sbin/aide
/var/spool/cron/root: 30 04 * * * root usr/sbin/aide
$ sudo more /etc/cron.daily/aide
#!/bin/bash
/usr/sbin/aide --check | /bin/mail -s "$HOSTNAME - Daily aide integrity check
run" root@sysname.mil
If the file integrity application does not exist, a script file controlling the execution of the
file integrity application does not exist, or the file integrity application does not notify
designated personnel of changes, this is a finding.
Remediation:
Configure the file integrity tool to run automatically on the system at least weekly and to
notify designated personnel if baseline configurations are changed in an unauthorized
manner. The AIDE tool can be configured to email designated personnel with the use of
the cron system.
The following example output is generic. It will set cron to run AIDE daily and to send
email at the completion of the analysis
$ sudo more /etc/cron.daily/aide

GROUP ID: V-258137
RULE ID: SV-258137r1045272
Rationale:
Protecting the integrity of the tools used for auditing purposes is a critical step toward
ensuring the integrity of audit information. Audit information includes all information
(e.g., audit records, audit settings, and audit reports) needed to successfully audit
information system activity.
Audit tools include, but are not limited to, vendor-provided and open-source audit tools
needed to successfully view and manipulate audit information system activity and
records. Audit tools include custom queries and report generators.
It is not uncommon for attackers to replace the audit tools or inject code into the existing
tools to provide the capability to hide or erase system activity from the audit logs.
To address this risk, audit tools must be cryptographically signed to provide the
capability to identify when the audit tools have been modified, manipulated, or replaced.
An example is a checksum hash of the file or files.

Profile Applicability:
•  SEVERITY: CAT II
Description:
RHEL 9 must be configured so that the rsyslog daemon does not accept log messages
from other servers unless the server is being used for log aggregation.
GROUP ID: V-258143
RULE ID: SV-258143r1045283
Rationale:
Unintentionally running a rsyslog server accepting remote messages puts the system at
increased risk. Malicious rsyslog messages sent to the server could exploit
vulnerabilities in the server software itself, could introduce misleading information into
the system's logs, or could fill the system's storage leading to a denial of service.
If the system is intended to be a log aggregation server, its use must be documented
with the information system security officer (ISSO).
Audit:
Verify that RHEL 9 is not configured to receive remote logs using rsyslog with the
following commands:
$ grep -i modload /etc/rsyslog.conf /etc/rsyslog.d/*
$ModLoad imtcp
$ModLoad imrelp
$ModLoad imudp
$ grep -i 'load="imtcp"' /etc/rsyslog.conf /etc/rsyslog.d/*
$ grep -i 'load="imrelp"' /etc/rsyslog.conf /etc/rsyslog.d/*
$ grep -i serverrun /etc/rsyslog.conf /etc/rsyslog.d/*
$InputTCPServerRun 514
$InputRELPServerRun 514
$InputUDPServerRun 514
$ grep -i 'port="\S*"' /etc/rsyslog.conf /etc/rsyslog.d/*
/etc/rsyslog.conf:#input(type="imudp" port="514")
/etc/rsyslog.conf:#input(type="imtcp" port="514")
/etc/rsyslog.conf:#Target="remote_host" Port="XXX" Protocol="tcp")
If any uncommented lines are returned by the commands, rsyslog is configured to
receive remote messages, and this is a finding.
Note: An error about no files or directories from the above commands may be returned.
This is not a finding.
If any modules are being loaded in the "/etc/rsyslog.conf" file or in the "/etc/rsyslog.d"
subdirectories, ask to see the documentation for the system being used for log
aggregation.
If the documentation does not exist or does not specify the server as a log aggregation
system, this is a finding.
Remediation:
Configure RHEL 9 to not receive remote logs using rsyslog.
Remove the lines in /etc/rsyslog.conf and any files in the /etc/rsyslog.d directory that
match any of the following:
module(load="imtcp")
module(load="imudp")
module(load="imrelp")
input(type="imudp" port="514")
input(type="imtcp" port="514")
input(type="imrelp" port="514")

GROUP ID: V-258144
RULE ID: SV-258144r1045286
Rationale:
Logging remote access methods can be used to trace the decrease in the risks
associated with remote user access management. It can also be used to spot
cyberattacks and ensure ongoing compliance with organizational policies surrounding
the use of remote access methods.
Audit:
Verify that RHEL 9 monitors all remote access methods.
Check that remote access methods are being logged by running the following
command:
$ grep -rE '(auth.\*|authpriv.\*|daemon.\*)' /etc/rsyslog.conf
/etc/rsyslog.d/

Rationale:
Without establishing what type of events occurred, the source of events, where events

example, time stamps, source and destination addresses, user/process identifiers,
event descriptions, success/fail indications, filenames involved, and access control or

Profile Applicability:
•  SEVERITY: CAT II
Description:
RHEL 9 audit service must be enabled.
GROUP ID: V-258152
RULE ID: SV-258152r1015127
Rationale:
Without establishing what type of events occurred, it would be difficult to establish,
correlate, and investigate the events leading up to an outage or attack. Ensuring the
"auditd" service is active ensures audit records generated by the kernel are
appropriately recorded.
Additionally, a properly configured audit subsystem ensures that actions of individual
system users can be uniquely traced to those users so they can be held accountable for
their actions.

Profile Applicability:
•  SEVERITY: CAT II
Description:
RHEL 9 audit system must take appropriate action when an error writing to the audit
storage volume occurs.
GROUP ID: V-258153
RULE ID: SV-258153r1038966
Rationale:
It is critical that when the operating system is at risk of failing to process audit logs as
required, it takes action to mitigate the failure. Audit processing failures include
software/hardware errors; failures in the audit capturing mechanisms; and audit storage
capacity being reached or exceeded. Responses to audit failure depend upon the
nature of the failure mode.
Audit:
Verify RHEL 9 takes the appropriate action when an audit processing failure occurs.
Check that RHEL 9 takes the appropriate action when an audit processing failure
occurs with the following command:
$ sudo grep disk_error_action /etc/audit/auditd.conf
disk_error_action = HALT
If the value of the "disk_error_action" option is not "SYSLOG", "SINGLE", or "HALT", or
the line is commented out, ask the system administrator (SA) to indicate how the
system takes appropriate action when an audit process failure occurs. If there is no
evidence of appropriate action, this is a finding.
Remediation:
Configure RHEL 9 to shut down by default upon audit failure (unless availability is an
overriding concern).
Add or update the following line (depending on configuration "disk_error_action" can be
set to "SYSLOG" or "SINGLE" depending on configuration) in "/etc/audit/auditd.conf"
file:
disk_error_action = HALT
If availability has been determined to be more important, and this decision is
documented with the information system security officer (ISSO), configure the operating
system to notify SA staff and ISSO staff in the event of an audit processing failure by
setting the "disk_error_action" to "SYSLOG".

1.371 RHEL-09-653030 (Manual)
Profile Applicability:
•  SEVERITY: CAT II
Description:
RHEL 9 must allocate audit record storage capacity to store at least one week's worth of
audit records.
GROUP ID: V-258155
RULE ID: SV-258155r1045300
Rationale:
To ensure RHEL 9 systems have a sufficient storage capacity in which to write the audit
logs, RHEL 9 needs to be able to allocate audit record storage capacity.
The task of allocating audit record storage capacity is usually performed during initial
installation of RHEL 9.
Satisfies: SRG-OS-000341-GPOS-00132, SRG-OS-000342-GPOS-00133
Audit:
Verify RHEL 9 allocates audit record storage capacity to store at least one week of audit
records when audit records are not immediately sent to a central audit record storage
facility.
Note: The partition size needed to capture a week of audit records is based on the
activity level of the system and the total storage capacity available. Typically 10.0GB of
storage space for audit records should be sufficient.
Determine which partition the audit records are being written to with the following
command:
$ sudo grep -w log_file /etc/audit/auditd.conf
log_file = /var/log/audit/audit.log
Check the size of the partition that audit records are written to with the following
command and verify whether it is sufficiently large:
# df -h /var/log/audit/
/dev/sda2 24G 10.4G 13.6G 43% /var/log/audit
If the audit record partition is not allocated for sufficient storage capacity, this is a
finding.
Remediation:
Allocate enough storage capacity for at least one week of audit records when audit
records are not immediately sent to a central audit record storage facility.
If audit records are stored on a partition made specifically for audit records, resize the
partition with sufficient space to contain one week of audit records.
If audit records are not stored on a partition made specifically for audit records, a new
partition with sufficient space will need be to be created.
Additional Information:

audit record retention requirements.

percent of the repository maximum audit record storage capacity.
GROUP ID: V-258156
RULE ID: SV-258156r971542
Rationale:
If security personnel are not notified immediately when storage volume reaches 75
percent utilization, they are unable to plan for audit record storage capacity expansion.
Audit:
Verify RHEL 9 takes action when allocated audit record storage volume reaches 75
percent of the repository maximum audit record storage capacity with the following
command:
$ sudo grep -w space_left /etc/audit/auditd.conf
space_left = 25%
If the value of the "space_left" keyword is not set to 25 percent of the storage volume
allocated to audit logs, or if the line is commented out, ask the system administrator
(SA) to indicate how the system is providing real-time alerts to the SA and information
system security officer (ISSO). If the "space_left" value is not configured to the correct
value, this is a finding.
Remediation:
Configure RHEL 9 to initiate an action to notify the SA and ISSO (at a minimum) when
allocated audit record storage volume reaches 75 percent of the repository maximum
audit record storage capacity by adding/modifying the following line in the
/etc/audit/auditd.conf file.
space_left  = 25%
Additional Information:

percent of the audit record storage capacity.
GROUP ID: V-258158
RULE ID: SV-258158r971542
Rationale:
If action is not taken when storage volume reaches 95 percent utilization, the auditing
system may fail when the storage volume reaches capacity.
Audit:
Verify RHEL 9 takes action when allocated audit record storage volume reaches 95
percent of the repository maximum audit record storage capacity with the following
command:
$ sudo grep -w admin_space_left /etc/audit/auditd.conf
admin_space_left = 5%
If the value of the "admin_space_left" keyword is not set to 5 percent of the storage
volume allocated to audit logs, or if the line is commented out, ask the system
administrator (SA) to indicate how the system is taking action if the allocated storage is
about to reach capacity. If the "space_left" value is not configured to the correct value,
this is a finding.
Remediation:
Configure RHEL 9 to initiate an action when allocated audit record storage volume
reaches 95 percent of the repository maximum audit record storage capacity by

GROUP ID: V-258160
RULE ID: SV-258160r1038966
Rationale:
It is critical that when the operating system is at risk of failing to process audit logs as
required, it takes action to mitigate the failure. Audit processing failures include
software/hardware errors; failures in the audit capturing mechanisms; and audit storage
capacity being reached or exceeded. Responses to audit failure depend upon the

If the value of the "max_log_file_action" option is not "ROTATE", "SINGLE", or the line
is commented out, ask the system administrator (SA)to indicate how the system takes
appropriate action when an audit storage volume is full. If there is no evidence of
appropriate action, this is a finding.

a minimum) must be alerted of an audit processing failure event.
GROUP ID: V-258163
RULE ID: SV-258163r958424
Rationale:
It is critical for the appropriate personnel to be aware if a system is at risk of failing to
process audit logs as required. Without this notification, the security personnel may be
unaware of an impending failure of the audit capability, and system operation may be
adversely affected.
Audit processing failures include software/hardware errors, failures in the audit
capturing mechanisms, and audit storage capacity being reached or exceeded.
This requirement applies to each audit data storage repository (i.e., distinct information
system component where audit records are stored), the centralized audit storage
capacity of organizations (i.e., all audit data storage repositories combined), or both.

Description:
RHEL 9 must write audit records to disk.
GROUP ID: V-258170
RULE ID: SV-258170r991589
Rationale:
Audit data should be synchronously written to disk to ensure log integrity. This setting
assures that all audit event data is written disk.
Audit:
Verify that the audit system is configured to write logs to the disk with the following
command:
$ sudo grep write_logs /etc/audit/auditd.conf
write_logs = yes
If "write_logs" does not have a value of "yes", the line is commented out, or the line is
missing, this is a finding.
Remediation:
Configure the audit system to write log files to the disk.
Edit the /etc/audit/auditd.conf file and add or update the "write_logs" option to "yes":

GROUP ID: V-258171
RULE ID: SV-258171r1045308
Rationale:
Without the capability to restrict the roles and individuals that can select which events
are audited, unauthorized personnel may be able to prevent the auditing of critical
events. Misconfigured audits may degrade the system's performance by overwhelming
the audit log. Misconfigured audits may also make it more difficult to establish, correlate,
and investigate the events relating to an incident or identify those responsible for one.
Audit:
Verify that the files in directory "/etc/audit/rules.d/" and "/etc/audit/auditd.conf" file have a
mode of "0640" or less permissive with the following command:
$ sudo find /etc/audit/rules.d/ /etc/audit/audit.rules /etc/audit/auditd.conf

Description:
RHEL 9 must allocate an audit_backlog_limit of sufficient size to capture processes that
start prior to the audit daemon.
GROUP ID: V-258173
RULE ID: SV-258173r991555
Rationale:
Without the capability to generate audit records, it would be difficult to establish,
correlate, and investigate the events relating to an incident or identify those responsible
for one.
If auditing is enabled late in the startup process, the actions of some startup processes
may not be audited. Some audit systems also maintain state information only available
if auditing is enabled before a given process is created.
Audit records can be generated from various components within the information system
(e.g., module or policy filter).
Allocating an audit_backlog_limit of sufficient size is critical in maintaining a stable boot
process. With an insufficient limit allocated, the system is susceptible to boot failures
and crashes.
Satisfies: SRG-OS-000254-GPOS-00095, SRG-OS-000341-GPOS-00132

Verify RHEL 9 allocates a sufficient audit_backlog_limit to capture processes that start
prior to the audit daemon with the following command:
$ sudo grubby --info=ALL | grep args | grep -v 'audit_backlog_limit=8192'
If the command returns any outputs, and audit_backlog_limit is less than "8192", this is
a finding.
Remediation:

Description:
RHEL 9 must have mail aliases to notify the information system security officer (ISSO)
and system administrator (SA) (at a minimum) in the event of an audit processing
failure.
GROUP ID: V-258174
RULE ID: SV-258174r958424
Rationale:
It is critical for the appropriate personnel to be aware if a system is at risk of failing to
process audit logs as required. Without this notification, the security personnel may be
unaware of an impending failure of the audit capability, and system operation may be
adversely affected.
Audit processing failures include software/hardware errors, failures in the audit
capturing mechanisms, and audit storage capacity being reached or exceeded.
This requirement applies to each audit data storage repository (i.e., distinct information
system component where audit records are stored), the centralized audit storage
capacity of organizations (i.e., all audit data storage repositories combined), or both.
Audit:
Verify that RHEL 9 is configured to notify the appropriate interactive users in the event
of an audit processing failure.
Find the alias maps that are being used with the following command:
$ postconf alias_maps
alias_maps = hash:/etc/aliases
Query the Postfix alias maps for an alias for the root user with the following command:
$ postmap -q root hash:/etc/aliases
isso
If an alias is not set, this is a finding.
Remediation:
Edit the aliases map file (by default /etc/aliases) used by Postfix and configure a root
alias (using the user ISSO as an example):
root:    ISSO
and then update the aliases database with the command:
$ sudo newaliases

GROUP ID: V-258176
RULE ID: SV-258176r1045313
Rationale:
Misuse of privileged functions, either intentionally or unintentionally by authorized users,
or by unauthorized external entities that have compromised information system
accounts, is a serious and ongoing concern and can have significant adverse impacts
on organizations. Auditing the use of privileged functions is one way to detect such
misuse and identify the risk from insider threats and the advanced persistent threat.
Satisfies: SRG-OS-000326-GPOS-00126, SRG-OS-000327-GPOS-00127
Audit:
Verify that RHEL 9 is configured to audit the execution of the "execve" system call with
the following command:
$ sudo auditctl -l | grep execve

If the command does not return all lines, or the lines are commented out, this is a
finding.
Remediation:
Configure RHEL 9 to audit the execution of the "execve" system call.
Add or update the following file system rules to "/etc/audit/rules.d/audit.rules":

RHEL 9 must audit all uses of the chmod, fchmod, and fchmodat system calls.
GROUP ID: V-258177
RULE ID: SV-258177r1045316
Rationale:
Without generating audit records that are specific to the security and mission needs of
the organization, it would be difficult to establish, correlate, and investigate the events
relating to an incident or identify those responsible for one.
Audit records can be generated from various components within the information system
(e.g., module or policy filter).
When a user logs on, the auid is set to the uid of the account being authenticated.
Daemons are not user sessions and have the loginuid set to -1. The auid representation
is an unsigned 32-bit integer, which equals 4294967295. The audit system interprets -1,
4294967295, and "unset" in the same way.
The system call rules are loaded into a matching engine that intercepts each system call
made by all programs on the system. Therefore, it is very important to use system call
rules only when absolutely necessary since these affect performance. The more rules,
the bigger the performance hit. The performance can be helped, however, by combining
system calls into one rule whenever possible.

Verify RHEL 9 is configured to audit the execution of the "setxattr", "fsetxattr", "lsetxattr",
"removexattr", "fremovexattr", and "lremovexattr" system calls with the following
command:
$ sudo auditctl -l | grep xattr
-a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S
setxattr,lsetxattr,fsetxattr,removexattr,lremovexattr,fremovexattr -F
auid>=1000 -F auid!=-1 -F key=perm_mod
-a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S
setxattr,lsetxattr,fsetxattr,removexattr,lremovexattr,fremovexattr -F
auid>=1000 -F auid!=-1 -F key=perm_mod
-a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S
setxattr,lsetxattr,fsetxattr,removexattr,lremovexattr,fremovexattr -F auid=0
-F key=perm_mod
-a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S
setxattr,lsetxattr,fsetxattr,removexattr,lremovexattr,fremovexattr -F auid=0
-F key=perm_mod
If both the "b32" and "b64" audit rules are not defined for the "setxattr", "fsetxattr",
"lsetxattr", "removexattr", "fremovexattr", and "lremovexattr" system calls, or any of the
lines returned are commented out, this is a finding.
Remediation:
Configure RHEL 9 to audit the execution of the "setxattr", "fsetxattr", "lsetxattr",
"removexattr", "fremovexattr", and "lremovexattr" system calls by adding or updating the
following lines to "/etc/audit/rules.d/audit.rules":
-a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S
setxattr,fsetxattr,lsetxattr,removexattr,fremovexattr,lremovexattr -F
auid>=1000 -F auid!=unset -k perm_mod
-a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S
setxattr,fsetxattr,lsetxattr,removexattr,fremovexattr,lremovexattr -F
auid>=1000 -F auid!=unset -k perm_mod
-a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S
setxattr,fsetxattr,lsetxattr,removexattr,fremovexattr,lremovexattr -F auid=0
-k perm_mod
-a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S
setxattr,fsetxattr,lsetxattr,removexattr,fremovexattr,lremovexattr -F auid=0
-k perm_mod

1.396 RHEL-09-654030 (Automated)
Profile Applicability:
•  SEVERITY: CAT II
Description:
RHEL 9 must audit all uses of umount system calls.
GROUP ID: V-258180
RULE ID: SV-258180r1045325
Rationale:
Without generating audit records specific to the security and mission needs of the
organization, it would be difficult to establish, correlate, and investigate the events
relating to an incident or identify those responsible for one.
Audit records can be generated from various components within the information system
(e.g., module or policy filter).
When a user logs on, the auid is set to the uid of the account being authenticated.
Daemons are not user sessions and have the loginuid set to -1. The auid representation
is an unsigned 32-bit integer, which equals 4294967295. The audit system interprets -1,
4294967295, and "unset" in the same way.
The system call rules are loaded into a matching engine that intercepts each system call
made by all programs on the system. Therefore, it is very important to use system call
rules only when absolutely necessary since these affect performance. The more rules,
the bigger the performance hit. The performance can be helped, however, by combining
system calls into one rule whenever possible.

Audit:
Verify that RHEL 9 is configured to audit the execution of the "umount" command with
the following command:

-a always,exit -S all -F path=/usr/bin/umount -F perm=x -F auid>=1000 -F
auid!=-1 -F key=privileged-mount
If the command does not return an audit rule for "umount" or any of the lines returned
are commented out, this is a finding.
Remediation:
Configure RHEL 9 to generate audit records upon successful/unsuccessful attempts to
use the "umount" command by adding or updating the following rules in

Description:
RHEL 9 must audit all uses of the setfiles command.
GROUP ID: V-258185
RULE ID: SV-258185r1045340
Rationale:
Without generating audit records specific to the security and mission needs of the
organization, it would be difficult to establish, correlate, and investigate the events
relating to an incident or identify those responsible for one.
Audit records can be generated from various components within the information system
(e.g., module or policy filter).
When a user logs on, the auid is set to the uid of the account being authenticated.
Daemons are not user sessions and have the loginuid set to -1. The auid representation
is an unsigned 32-bit integer, which equals 4294967295. The audit system interprets -1,
4294967295, and "unset" in the same way.
The system call rules are loaded into a matching engine that intercepts each system call
made by all programs on the system. Therefore, it is very important to use system call
rules only when absolutely necessary since these affect performance. The more rules,
the bigger the performance hit. The performance can be helped, however, by combining
system calls into one rule whenever possible.

Without generating audit records specific to the security and mission needs of the
organization, it would be difficult to establish, correlate, and investigate the events
relating to an incident or identify those responsible for one.
Audit records can be generated from various components within the information system
(e.g., module or policy filter).
When a user logs on, the auid is set to the uid of the account being authenticated.
Daemons are not user sessions and have the loginuid set to -1. The auid representation
is an unsigned 32-bit integer, which equals 4294967295. The audit system interprets -1,
4294967295, and "unset" in the same way.
The system call rules are loaded into a matching engine that intercepts each system call
made by all programs on the system. Therefore, it is very important to use system call
rules only when absolutely necessary since these affect performance. The more rules,
the bigger the performance hit. The performance can be helped, however, by combining
system calls into one rule whenever possible.

Audit:
Verify that RHEL 9 is configured to audit the execution of the "init_module" and
"finit_module" system calls with the following command:
$ sudo auditctl -l | grep init_module
-a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S init_module,finit_module -F auid>=1000 -F
auid!=-1 -F key=module_chng
-a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S init_module,finit_module -F auid>=1000 -F
auid!=-1 -F key=module_chng
If both the "b32" and "b64" audit rules are not defined for the "init_module" system call,
or any of the lines returned are commented out, this is a finding.
Remediation:
Configure RHEL 9 to generate an audit event for any successful/unsuccessful use of
the "init_module" and "finit_module" system calls by adding or updating the following
rules in the "/etc/audit/rules.d/audit.rules" file:
-a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S init_module,finit_module -F auid>=1000 -F
auid!=unset -k module_chng
-a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S init_module,finit_module -F auid>=1000 -F

representation is an unsigned 32-bit integer, which equals 4294967295. The audit
system interprets -1, 4294967295, and "unset" in the same way.
The system call rules are loaded into a matching engine that intercepts each system call
made by all programs on the system. Therefore, it is very important to use system call
rules only when absolutely necessary since these affect performance. The more rules,
the bigger the performance hit. The performance can be helped, however, by combining
system calls into one rule whenever possible.

Audit:
Verify that RHEL 9 is configured to audit the execution of the "newgrp" command with
the following command:
$ sudo auditctl -l | grep newgrp
-a always,exit -S all -F path=/usr/bin/newgrp -F perm=x -F auid>=1000 -F
auid!=-1 -F key=priv_cmd
If the command does not return a line, or the line is commented out, this is a finding.
Remediation:
Configure RHEL 9 to generate audit records upon successful/unsuccessful attempts to
use the "newgrp" command by adding or updating the following rule in
"/etc/audit/rules.d/audit.rules":
-a always,exit -F path=/usr/bin/newgrp -F perm=x -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=unset

Audit records can be generated from various components within the information system
(e.g., module or policy filter).
When a user logs on, the auid is set to the uid of the account being authenticated.
Daemons are not user sessions and have the loginuid set to -1. The auid representation
is an unsigned 32-bit integer, which equals 4294967295. The audit system interprets -1,
4294967295, and "unset" in the same way.
The system call rules are loaded into a matching engine that intercepts each system call
made by all programs on the system. Therefore, it is very important to use system call
rules only when absolutely necessary since these affect performance. The more rules,
the bigger the performance hit. The performance can be helped, however, by combining
system calls into one rule whenever possible.

Audit:
Verify that RHEL 9 is configured to audit the execution of the "ssh-keysign" command
with the following command:
$ sudo auditctl -l | grep ssh-keysign
-a always,exit -S all -F path=/usr/libexec/openssh/ssh-keysign -F perm=x -F

Remediation:
Configure RHEL 9 to generate audit records upon successful/unsuccessful attempts to
use the "ssh-keysign" command by adding or updating the following rule in

1.424 RHEL-09-654170 (Automated)
Profile Applicability:
•  SEVERITY: CAT II
Description:
RHEL 9 must audit all uses of the userhelper command.
GROUP ID: V-258208
RULE ID: SV-258208r1045409
Rationale:
Without generating audit record specific to the security and mission needs of the
organization, it would be difficult to establish, correlate, and investigate the events
relating to an incident or identify those responsible for one.
Audit records can be generated from various components within the information system
(e.g., module or policy filter).
When a user logs on, the auid is set to the uid of the account being authenticated.
Daemons are not user sessions and have the loginuid set to -1. The auid representation
is an unsigned 32-bit integer, which equals 4294967295. The audit system interprets -1,
4294967295, and "unset" in the same way.
The system call rules are loaded into a matching engine that intercepts each system call
made by all programs on the system. Therefore, it is very important to use system call
rules only when absolutely necessary since these affect performance. The more rules,
the bigger the performance hit. The performance can be helped, however, by combining
system calls into one rule whenever possible.

Audit:
Verify that RHEL 9 is configured to audit the execution of the "userhelper" command
with the following command:
$ sudo auditctl -l | grep userhelper
-a always,exit -S all -F path=/usr/sbin/userhelper -F perm=x -F auid>=1000 -F
auid!=-1 -F key=privileged-unix-update
If the command does not return a line, or the line is commented out, this is a finding.
Remediation:
Configure RHEL 9 to generate audit records upon successful/unsuccessful attempts to
use the "userhelper" command by adding or updating the following rule in
"/etc/audit/rules.d/audit.rules":
-a always,exit -F path=/usr/sbin/userhelper -F perm=x -F auid>=1000 -F
auid!=unset -k privileged-unix-update

Profile Applicability:

Description:
RHEL 9 must generate audit records for all account creations, modifications, disabling,
and termination events that affect /etc/sudoers.
GROUP ID: V-258217
RULE ID: SV-258217r1045436
Rationale:
The actions taken by system administrators must be audited to keep a record of what
was executed on the system, as well as for accountability purposes. Editing the sudoers
file may be sign of an attacker trying to establish persistent methods to a system,
auditing the editing of the sudoers files mitigates this risk.

GROUP ID: V-258226
RULE ID: SV-258226r958846
Rationale:
Without generating audit records specific to the security and mission needs of the
organization, it would be difficult to establish, correlate, and investigate the events
relating to an incident or identify those responsible for one.

Audit:
Verify RHEL 9 generates audit records for all account creations, modifications,
disabling, and termination events that affect "/var/log/tallylog" with the following
command:
$ sudo auditctl -l | grep /var/log/tallylog
-w /var/log/tallylog -p wa -k logins
If the command does not return a line, or the line is commented out, is a finding.
Remediation:
Configure RHEL 9 to generate audit records for all account creations, modifications,
disabling, and termination events that affect "/var/log/tallylog".
Add or update the following file system rule to "/etc/audit/rules.d/audit.rules":
-w /var/log/tallylog -p wa -k logins

Description:
RHEL 9 must take appropriate action when a critical audit processing failure occurs.
GROUP ID: V-258227
RULE ID: SV-258227r1014992
Rationale:
It is critical for the appropriate personnel to be aware if a system is at risk of failing to
process audit logs as required. Without this notification, the security personnel may be
unaware of an impending failure of the audit capability, and system operation may be
adversely affected.
Audit processing failures include software/hardware errors, failures in the audit
capturing mechanisms, and audit storage capacity being reached or exceeded.
Satisfies: SRG-OS-000046-GPOS-00022, SRG-OS-000047-GPOS-00023
Audit:
Verify the audit service is configured to panic on a critical error with the following
command:
$ sudo grep "\-f" /etc/audit/audit.rules
-f 2
If the value for "-f" is not "2", and availability is not documented as an overriding
concern, this is a finding.
Remediation:
Configure RHEL 9 to shut down when auditing failures occur.

Description:
RHEL 9 audit system must protect auditing rules from unauthorized change.
GROUP ID: V-258229
RULE ID: SV-258229r958434
Rationale:
Unauthorized disclosure of audit records can reveal system and configuration data to
attackers, thus compromising its confidentiality.
Audit information includes all information (e.g., audit records, audit settings, audit
reports) needed to successfully audit RHEL 9 system activity.
In immutable mode, unauthorized users cannot execute changes to the audit system to
potentially hide malicious activity and then put the audit rules back. A system reboot
would be noticeable, and a system administrator could then investigate the
unauthorized changes.

RHEL 9 must employ FIPS 140-3 approved cryptographic hashing algorithms for all
stored passwords.
GROUP ID: V-258231
RULE ID: SV-258231r1069375
Rationale:
The system must use a strong hashing algorithm to store the password.
Passwords need to be protected at all times, and encryption is the standard method for
protecting passwords. If passwords are not encrypted, they can be plainly read (i.e.,
clear text) and easily compromised.
Satisfies: SRG-OS-000073-GPOS-00041, SRG-OS-000120-GPOS-00061

FIPS 140-3 approved cryptographic hashing algorithm for system authentication.
GROUP ID: V-258233
RULE ID: SV-258233r1015136
Rationale:
Unapproved mechanisms that are used for authentication to the cryptographic module
are not verified and; therefore, cannot be relied upon to provide confidentiality or
integrity, and DOD data may be compromised.
RHEL 9 systems utilizing encryption are required to use FIPS-compliant mechanisms
for authenticating to cryptographic modules.
FIPS 140-3 is the current standard for validating that mechanisms used to access
cryptographic modules utilize authentication that meets DOD requirements. This allows
for Security Levels 1, 2, 3, or 4 for use on a general-purpose computing system.
Audit:
Verify that the pam_unix.so module is configured to use sha512 in
/etc/pam.d/password-auth with the following command:
$ grep "^password.*pam_unix.so.*sha512" /etc/pam.d/password-auth
password sufficient pam_unix.so sha512
If "sha512" is missing, or the line is commented out, this is a finding.
If the system administrator (SA) can demonstrate that the required configuration is
contained in a PAM configuration file included or substacked from the system-auth file,
this is not a finding.
Remediation:
Configure RHEL 9 to use a FIPS 140-3 approved cryptographic hashing algorithm for
system authentication.

Note: If the "bind" package is not installed, this requirement is Not Applicable.
$ sudo grep include /etc/named.conf
include "/etc/crypto-policies/back-ends/bind.config";'
If BIND is installed and the BIND config file doesn't contain the include "/etc/crypto-
policies/back-ends/bind.config" directive, or the line is commented out, this is a finding.
Remediation:
Configure BIND to use the system crypto policy.
Add the following line to the "options" section in "/etc/named.conf":
include "/etc/crypto-policies/back-ends/bind.config";
