      "Description": "This policy setting determines the number of renewed, unique passwords that have to be associated with a user account before you can reuse an old password. The value for this policy setting must be between 0 and 24 passwords. The default value for Windows Vista is 0 passwords, but the default setting in a domain is 24 passwords. To maintain the effectiveness of this policy setting, use the Minimum password age setting to prevent users from repeatedly changing their password. The recommended state for this setting is: 24 or more password(s). Note: Password Policy settings (section 1.1) and Account Lockout Policy settings (section 1.2) must be applied via the Default Domain Policy GPO in order to be globally in effect on domain user accounts as their default behavior. If these settings are configured in another GPO, they will only affect local user accounts on the computers that receive the GPO. However, custom exceptions to the default password policy and account lockout policy rules for specific domain users and/or groups can be defined using Password Settings Objects (PSOs), which are completely separate from Group Policy and most easily configured using Active Directory Administrative Center. Note #2: As of the publication of this benchmark, Microsoft currently has a maximum limit of 24 saved passwords. For more information, please visit Enforce password history (Windows 10) - Windows security | Microsoft Docs",
      "Rationale": "The longer a user uses the same password, the greater the chance that an attacker can determine the password through brute force attacks. Also, any accounts that may have been compromised will remain exploitable for as long as the password is left unchanged. If password changes are required but password reuse is not prevented, or if users continually reuse a small number of passwords, the effectiveness of a good password policy is greatly reduced. If you specify a low number for this policy setting, users will be able to use the same small number of passwords repeatedly. If you do not also configure the Minimum password age setting, users might repeatedly change their passwords until they can reuse their original password.",
      "Impact": "The major impact of this configuration is that users must create a new password every time they are required to change their old one. If users are required to change their passwords to new unique values, there is an increased risk of users who write their passwords somewhere so that they do not forget them. Another risk is that users may create passwords that change incrementally (for example, password01, password02, and so on) to facilitate memorization but make them easier to guess. Also, an excessively low value for the Minimum password age setting will likely increase administrative overhead, because users who forget their passwords might ask the help desk to reset them frequently.",

      "Description": "This policy setting defines how long a user can use their password before it expires. Values for this policy setting range from 0 to 999 days. If you set the value to 0, the password will never expire. Because attackers can crack passwords, the more frequently you change the password the less opportunity an attacker has to use a cracked password. However, the lower this value is set, the higher the potential for an increase in calls to help desk support due to users having to change their password or forgetting which password is current. The recommended state for this setting is 365 or fewer days, but not 0.

      "Rationale": "The longer a password exists the higher the likelihood that it will be compromised by a brute force attack, by an attacker gaining general knowledge about the user, or by the user sharing the password. Configuring the Maximum password age setting to 0 so that users are never required to change their passwords is a major security risk because that allows a compromised password to be used by the malicious user for as long as the valid user has authorized access.",
      "Impact": "If the Maximum password age setting is too low, users are required to change their passwords very often. Such a configuration can reduce security in the organization, because users might write their passwords in an insecure location or lose them. If the value for this policy setting is too high, the level of security within an organization is reduced because it allows potential attackers more time in which to discover user passwords or to use compromised accounts.",

Unfortunately, passwords are compromised and if an attacker is targeting a specific individual user account, with foreknowledge of data about that user, reuse of old passwords can cause a security breach. To address password reuse a combination of security settings is required. Using this policy setting with the Enforce password history setting prevents the easy reuse of old passwords. For example, if you configure the Enforce password history setting to ensure that users cannot reuse any of their last 12 passwords, they could change their password 13 times in a few minutes and reuse the password they started with, unless you also configure the Minimum password age setting to a number that is greater than 0. You must configure this policy setting to a number that is greater than 0 for the Enforce password history setting to be effective.",
      "Impact": "If an administrator sets a password for a user but wants that user to change the password when the user first logs on, the administrator must select the User must change password at next logon check box, or the user will not be able to change the password until the next day.",

      "Description": "This policy setting determines the least number of characters that make up a password for a user account. There are many different theories about how to determine the best password length for an organization, but perhaps \"passphrase\" is a better term than \"password.\" In Microsoft Windows 2000 and newer, passphrases can be quite long and can include spaces. Therefore, a phrase such as \"I want to drink a $5 milkshake\" is a valid passphrase; it is a considerably stronger password than an 8 or 10 character string of random numbers and letters, and yet is easier to remember. Users must be educated about the proper selection and maintenance of passwords, especially with regard to password length. In enterprise environments, the ideal value for the Minimum password length setting is 14 characters, however you should adjust this value to meet your organization's business requirements. The recommended state for this setting is: 14 or more character(s). Note: In Windows Server 2016 and older versions of Windows Server, the GUI of the Local Security Policy (LSP), Local Group Policy Editor (LGPE) and Group Policy Management Editor (GPME) would not let you set this value higher than 14 characters. However, starting with Windows Server 2019, Microsoft changed the GUI to allow up to a 20 character minimum password length. Note #2: Password Policy settings (section 1.1) and Account Lockout Policy settings (section 1.2) must be applied via the Default Domain Policy GPO in order to be globally in effect on domain user accounts as their default behavior. If these settings are configured in another GPO, they will only affect local user accounts on the computers that receive the GPO. However, custom exceptions to the default password policy and account lockout policy rules for specific domain users and/or groups can be defined using Password Settings Objects (PSOs), which are completely separate from Group Policy and most easily configured using Active Directory Administrative Center.",
      "Rationale": "Types of password attacks include dictionary attacks (which attempt to use common words and phrases) and brute force attacks (which try every possible combination of characters). Also, attackers sometimes try to obtain the account database so they can use tools to discover the accounts and passwords.",
      "Impact": "Requirements for extremely long passwords can actually decrease the security of an organization, because users might leave the information in an insecure location or lose it. If very long passwords are required, mistyped passwords could cause account lockouts and increase the volume of help desk calls. If your organization has issues with forgotten passwords due to password length requirements, consider teaching your users about passphrases, which are often easier to remember and, due to the larger number of character combinations, much harder to discover. Note: Older versions of Windows such as Windows 98 and Windows NT 4.0 do not support passwords that are longer than 14 characters. Computers that run these older operating systems are unable to authenticate with computers or domains that use accounts that require long passwords.",

      "Profile Applicability": "\uf0b7 Level 1 - Domain Controller \uf0b7 Level 1 - Member Server",
      "Description": "This policy setting checks all new passwords to ensure that they meet basic requirements for strong passwords. When this policy is enabled, passwords must meet the following minimum requirements: \uf0b7 Not contain the user's account name or parts of the user's full name that exceed two consecutive characters \uf0b7 Be at least six characters in length \uf0b7 Contain characters from three of the following categories: o English uppercase characters (A through Z) o English lowercase characters (a through z) o Base 10 digits (0 through 9) o Non-alphabetic characters (for example, !, $, #, %) o A catch-all category of any Unicode character that does not fall under the previous four categories. This fifth category can be regionally specific. Each additional character in a password increases its complexity exponentially. For instance, a seven-character, all lower-case alphabetic password would have 267 (approximately 8 x 109 or 8 billion) possible combinations. At 1,000,000 attempts per second (a capability of many password-cracking utilities), it would only take 133 minutes to crack. A seven-character alphabetic password with case sensitivity has 527 combinations. A seven-character case-sensitive alphanumeric password without punctuation has 627 combinations. An eight-character password has 268 (or 2 x 1011) possible combinations. Although this might seem to be a large number, at 1,000,000 attempts per second it would take only 59 hours to try all possible passwords. Remember, these times will significantly increase for passwords that use ALT characters and other special keyboard characters such as \"!\" or \"@\". Proper use of the password settings can help make it difficult to mount a brute force attack. The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled. Note: Password Policy settings (section 1.1) and Account Lockout Policy settings (section 1.2) must be applied via the Default Domain Policy GPO in order to be globally in effect on domain user accounts as their default behavior. If these settings are configured in another GPO, they will only affect local user accounts on the computers that receive the GPO. However, custom exceptions to the default password policy and account lockout policy rules for specific domain users and/or groups can be defined using Password Settings Objects (PSOs), which are completely separate from Group Policy and most easily configured using Active Directory Administrative Center.",
      "Rationale": "Passwords that contain only alphanumeric characters are extremely easy to discover with several publicly available tools.",
      "Impact": "If the default password complexity configuration is retained, additional help desk calls for locked-out accounts could occur because users might not be accustomed to passwords that contain non-alphabetic characters. However, all users should be able to comply with the complexity requirement with minimal difficulty. If your organization has more stringent security requirements, you can create a custom version of the Passfilt.dll file that allows the use of arbitrarily complex password strength rules. For example, a custom password filter might require the use of non-upper row characters. (Upper row characters are those that require you to hold down the SHIFT key and press any of the digits between 1 and 0.) A custom password filter might also perform a dictionary check to verify that the proposed password does not contain common dictionary words or fragments. Also, the use of ALT key character combinations can greatly enhance the complexity of a password. However, such stringent password requirements can result in unhappy users and an extremely busy help desk. Alternatively, your organization could consider a requirement for all administrator passwords to use ALT characters in the 0128 - 0159 range. (ALT characters outside of this range can represent standard alphanumeric characters that would not add additional complexity to the password.)",

      "Description": "This policy setting determines whether the operating system stores passwords in a way that uses reversible encryption, which provides support for application protocols that require knowledge of the user's password for authentication purposes. Passwords that are stored with reversible encryption are essentially the same as plaintext versions of the passwords. The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled. Note: Password Policy settings (section 1.1) and Account Lockout Policy settings (section 1.2) must be applied via the Default Domain Policy GPO in order to be globally in effect on domain user accounts as their default behavior. If these settings are configured in another GPO, they will only affect local user accounts on the computers that receive the GPO. However, custom exceptions to the default password policy and account lockout policy rules for specific domain users and/or groups can be defined using Password Settings Objects (PSOs), which are completely separate from Group Policy and most easily configured using Active Directory Administrative Center.",
      "Rationale": "Enabling this policy setting allows the operating system to store passwords in a weaker format that is much more susceptible to compromise and weakens your system security.",
      "Impact": "If your organization uses either the CHAP authentication protocol through remote access or IAS services or Digest Authentication in IIS, you must configure this policy setting to Enabled.

The setting does this by specifying the number of minutes a locked out account will remain unavailable. If the value for this policy setting is configured to 0, locked out accounts will remain locked out until an administrator manually unlocks them. Although it might seem like a good idea to configure the value for this policy setting to a high value, such a configuration will likely increase the number of calls that the help desk receives to unlock accounts locked by mistake. Users should be aware of the length of time a lock remains in place, so that they realize they only need to call the help desk if they have an extremely urgent need to regain access to their computer. The recommended state for this setting is: 15 or more minute(s). Note: Password Policy settings (section 1.1) and Account Lockout Policy settings (section 1.2) must be applied via the Default Domain Policy GPO in order to be globally in effect on domain user accounts as their default behavior.

If the Account lockout threshold is defined, this reset time must be less than or equal to the value for the Account lockout duration setting. If you leave this policy setting at its default value or configure the value to an interval that is too long, your environment could be vulnerable to a DoS attack. An attacker could maliciously perform a number of failed logon attempts on all users in the organization, which will lock out their accounts. If no policy were determined to reset the account lockout, it would be a manual task for administrators.

An attacker could maliciously attempt to log on to each user's account numerous times and lock out their accounts as described in the preceding paragraphs. If you do not configure the Reset account lockout counter after setting, administrators would have to manually unlock all accounts. If you configure this policy setting to a reasonable value the users would be locked out for some period, after which their accounts would unlock automatically.

      "Description": "This policy setting specifies which users can add computer workstations to the domain. For this policy setting to take effect, it must be assigned to the user as part of the Default Domain Controller Policy for the domain. A user who has been assigned this right can add up to 10 workstations to the domain. Users who have been assigned the Create Computer Objects permission for an OU or the Computers container in Active Directory can add an unlimited number of computers to the domain, regardless of whether or not they have been assigned the Add workstations to domain user right. In Windows-based networks, the term security principal is defined as a user, group, or computer that is automatically assigned a security identifier to control access to resources. In an Active Directory domain, each computer account is a full security principal with the ability to authenticate and access domain resources. However, some organizations may want to limit the number of computers in an Active Directory environment so that they can consistently track, build, and manage the computers. If users are allowed to add computers to the domain, tracking and management efforts would be hampered. Also, users could perform activities that are more difficult to trace because of their ability to create additional unauthorized domain computers. The recommended state for this setting is: Administrators.",
      "Rationale": "The Add workstations to domain user right presents a moderate vulnerability. Users with this right could add a computer to the domain that is configured in a way that violates organizational security policies. For example, if your organization does not want its users to have administrative privileges on their computers, a user could (re-)install Windows on his or her computer and then add the computer to the domain. The user would know the password for the local Administrator account, and could log on with that account and then add his or her domain account to the local Administrators group.",
      "Impact": "For organizations that have never allowed users to set up their own computers and add them to the domain, this countermeasure will have no impact. For those that have allowed some or all users to configure their own computers, this countermeasure will force the organization to establish a formal process for these procedures going forward.

      "Profile Applicability": "\uf0b7 Level 1 - Domain Controller \uf0b7 Level 1 - Member Server",
      "Description": "This policy setting determines which users and groups can change the time and date on the internal clock of the computers in your environment. Users who are assigned this user right can affect the appearance of event logs. When a computer's time setting is changed, logged events reflect the new time, not the actual time that the events occurred. The recommended state for this setting is: Administrators, LOCAL SERVICE. Note: Discrepancies between the time on the local computer and on the Domain Controllers in your environment may cause problems for the Kerberos authentication protocol, which could make it impossible for users to log on to the domain or obtain authorization to access domain resources after they are logged on. Also, problems will occur when Group Policy is applied to client computers if the system time is not synchronized with the Domain Controllers.",
      "Rationale": "Users who can change the time on a computer could cause several problems. For example, time stamps on event log entries could be made inaccurate, time stamps on files and folders that are created or modified could be incorrect, and computers that belong to a domain may not be able to authenticate themselves or users who try to log on to the domain from them. Also, because the Kerberos authentication protocol requires that the requestor and authenticator have their clocks synchronized within an administrator-defined skew period, an attacker who changes a computer's time may cause that computer to be unable to obtain or grant Kerberos tickets. The risk from these types of events is mitigated on most Domain Controllers, Member Servers, and end-user computers because the Windows Time service automatically synchronizes time with Domain Controllers in the following ways: \uf0b7 All client desktop computers and Member Servers use the authenticating Domain Controller as their inbound time partner. \uf0b7 All Domain Controllers in a domain nominate the Primary Domain Controller (PDC) Emulator operations master as their inbound time partner. \uf0b7 All PDC Emulator operations masters follow the hierarchy of domains in the selection of their inbound time partner. \uf0b7 The PDC Emulator operations master at the root of the domain is authoritative for the organization. Therefore it is recommended that you configure this computer to synchronize with a reliable external time server. This vulnerability becomes much more serious if an attacker is able to change the system time and then stop the Windows Time service or reconfigure it to synchronize with a time server that is not accurate.",
      "Impact": "There should be no impact, because time synchronization for most organizations should be fully automated for all computers that belong to the domain. Computers that do not belong to the domain should be configured to synchronize with an external source.",

      "Description": "This policy setting determines which user accounts will have the right to attach a debugger to any process or to the kernel, which provides complete access to sensitive and critical operating system components.

      "Rationale": "The Debug programs user right can be exploited to capture sensitive computer information from system memory, or to access and modify kernel or application structures. Some attack tools exploit this user right to extract hashed passwords and other private security information, or to insert rootkit code. By default, the Debug programs user right is assigned only to administrators, which helps to mitigate the risk from this vulnerability.",
      "Impact": "If you revoke this user right, no one will be able to debug programs. However, typical circumstances rarely require this capability on production computers. If a problem arises that requires an application to be debugged on a production server, you can move the server to a different OU temporarily and assign the Debug programs user right to a separate Group Policy for that OU. The service account that is used for the cluster service needs the Debug programs user right; if it does not have it, Windows Clustering will fail. Tools that are used to manage processes will be unable to affect processes that are not owned by the person who runs the tools. For example, the Windows Server 2003 Resource Kit tool Kill.exe requires this user right for administrators to terminate processes that they did not start.",

      "Description": "This policy setting determines which users can bypass file, directory, registry, and other persistent object permissions when restoring backed up files and directories on computers that run Windows Vista (or newer) in your environment. This user right also determines which users can set valid security principals as object owners; it is similar to the Back up files and directories user right. The recommended state for this setting is: Administrators. Note: This user right is considered a \"sensitive privilege\" for the purposes of auditing.",
      "Rationale": "An attacker with the Restore files and directories user right could restore sensitive data to a computer and overwrite data that is more recent, which could lead to loss of important data, data corruption, or a denial of service. Attackers could overwrite executable files that are used by legitimate administrators or system services with versions that include malicious software to grant themselves elevated privileges, compromise data, or install backdoors for continued access to the computer. Note: Even if the following countermeasure is configured, an attacker could still restore data to a computer in a domain that is controlled by the attacker. Therefore, it is critical that organizations carefully protect the media that is used to back up data.",
      "Impact": "If you remove the Restore files and directories user right from the Backup Operators group and other accounts you could make it impossible for users who have been delegated specific tasks to perform those tasks. You should verify that this change won't negatively affect the ability of your organization's personnel to do their jobs.",

When a computer is booted into safe mode, the Administrator account is always enabled, regardless of how this setting is configured. Note that this setting will have no impact when applied to the Domain Controllers organizational unit via group policy because Domain Controllers have no local account database. It can be configured at the domain level via group policy, similar to account lockout and password policy settings. The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.",
      "Rationale": "In some organizations, it can be a daunting management challenge to maintain a regular schedule for periodic password changes for local accounts. Therefore, you may want to disable the built-in Administrator account instead of relying on regular password changes to protect it from attack. Another reason to disable this built-in account is that it cannot be locked out no matter how many failed logons it accrues, which makes it a prime target for brute force attacks that attempt to guess passwords. Also, this account has a well-known security identifier (SID) and there are third-party tools that allow authentication by using the SID rather than the account name. This capability means that even if you rename the Administrator account, an attacker could launch a brute force attack by using the SID to log on.",
      "Impact": "Maintenance issues can arise under certain circumstances if you disable the Administrator account. For example, if the secure channel between a member computer and the Domain Controller fails in a domain environment for any reason and there is no other local Administrator account, you must restart in safe mode to fix the problem that broke the secure channel. If the current Administrator password does not meet the password requirements, you will not be able to re-enable the Administrator account after it is disabled. If this situation occurs, another member of the Administrators group must set the password on the Administrator account with the Local Users and Groups tool.",

In fact, the default settings for Active Directory domains require complex passwords of at least seven characters.

For example, a user could build a stand-alone computer, create one or more accounts with blank passwords, and then join the computer to the domain. The local accounts with blank passwords would still function. Anyone who knows the name of one of these unprotected accounts could then use it to log on.",

      "Description": "The built-in local administrator account is a well-known account name that attackers will target. It is recommended to choose another name for this account, and to avoid names that denote administrative or elevated access accounts. Be sure to also change the default description for the local administrator (through the Computer Management console). On Domain Controllers, since they do not have their own local accounts, this rule refers to the built-in Administrator account that was established when the domain was first created.",
      "Rationale": "The Administrator account exists on all computers that run the Windows 2000 or newer operating systems. If you rename this account, it is slightly more difficult for unauthorized persons to guess this privileged user name and password combination. The built-in Administrator account cannot be locked out, regardless of how many times an attacker might use a bad password. This capability makes the Administrator account a popular target for brute force attacks that attempt to guess passwords. The value of this countermeasure is lessened because this account has a well-known SID, and there are third-party tools that allow authentication by using the SID rather than the account name. Therefore, even if you rename the Administrator account, an attacker could launch a brute force attack by using the SID to log on.",

The recommended state for this setting is: Always. Note: All LDAP clients must have the CVC-2017-8563 security update to be compatible with Domain Controllers that have this setting enabled. More information on this setting is available at: MSKB 4520412: 2020 LDAP channel binding and LDAP signing requirements for Windows",
      "Rationale": "Requiring Channel Binding Tokens (CBT) can prevent an attacker who is able to capture users' authentication credentials (e.g. OAuth tokens, session identifiers, etc.) from reusing those credentials in another TLS session. This also helps to increase protection against \"man-in-the-middle\" attacks using LDAP authentication over SSL/TLS (LDAPS).",
      "Impact": "All LDAP clients must provide channel binding information over SSL/TLS (i.e. LDAPS). The LDAP server (Domain Controller) rejects authentication requests from clients that do not do so. Clients must have the CVC-2017-8563 security update to support this feature, and may have compatibility issues with this setting without the security update. This may also mean that LDAP authentication requests over SSL/TLS that previously worked may stop working until the security update is installed. When first deploying this setting, you may initially want to only set it to the alternate setting of When supported (instead of Always) on all Domain Controllers. This alternate, interim setting enables support for LDAP client channel binding but does not require it. Then set one DC that is not currently being targeted by LDAP clients to Always, and test each of the critical LDAP clients against that DC (and remediating as necessary), before deploying Always to the rest of the DCs. We also recommend using the new Event ID 3039 on your Domain Controllers (added with the March 2020 security update) to help locate clients that do not use Channel Binding Tokens (CBT) in their LDAPS connections. This new Event ID requires increasing the logging level of the 16 LDAP Interface Events portion of the NTDS service diagnostics to a value of 2 (Basic). For more information, please see Table 2: CBT events at this link: MSKB 4520412: 2020 LDAP channel binding and LDAP signing requirements for Windows Older OSes such as Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008 (non-R2), will first require patches for Microsoft Security Advisory 973811, as well as all associated fixes, in order to be compatible with domain controllers that have this setting deployed.

      "Description": "This policy setting determines whether the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) server requires LDAP clients to negotiate data signing. The recommended state for this setting is: Require signing. Note: Domain member computers must have Network security: LDAP signing requirements (Rule 2.3.11.8) set to Negotiate signing or higher. If not, they will fail to authenticate once the above Require signing value is configured on the Domain Controllers. Fortunately, Negotiate signing is the default in the client configuration. Note #2: This policy setting does not have any impact on LDAP simple bind (ldap_simple_bind) or LDAP simple bind through SSL (ldap_simple_bind_s). No Microsoft LDAP clients that are shipped with Windows XP Professional use LDAP simple bind or LDAP simple bind through SSL to talk to a Domain Controller. Note #3: Before enabling this setting, you should first ensure that there are no clients (including server-based applications) that are configured to authenticate with Active Directory via unsigned LDAP, because changing this setting will break those applications. Such applications should first be reconfigured to use signed LDAP, Secure LDAP (LDAPS), or IPsec-protected connections. For more information on how to identify whether your DCs are being accessed via unsigned LDAP (and where those accesses are coming from), see this Microsoft TechNet blog article: Identifying Clear Text LDAP binds to your DC\u2019s \u2013 Practical Windows Security",
      "Rationale": "Unsigned network traffic is susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks. In such attacks, an intruder captures packets between the server and the client, modifies them, and then forwards them to the client. Where LDAP servers are concerned, an attacker could cause a client to make decisions that are based on false records from the LDAP directory. To lower the risk of such an intrusion in an organization's network, you can implement strong physical security measures to protect the network infrastructure. Also, you could implement Internet Protocol security (IPsec) authentication header mode (AH), which performs mutual authentication and packet integrity for IP traffic to make all types of man- in-the-middle attacks extremely difficult. Additionally, allowing the use of regular, unsigned LDAP permits credentials to be received over the network in clear text, which could very easily result in the interception of account passwords by other systems on the network.",
      "Impact": "Unless TLS/SSL is being used, the LDAP data signing option must be negotiated. Clients that do not support LDAP signing will be unable to run LDAP queries against the Domain Controllers. All Windows 2000-based computers in your organization that are managed from Windows Server 2003-based or Windows XP-based computers and that use Windows NT Challenge/Response (NTLM) authentication must have Windows 2000 Service Pack 3 (SP3) installed. Alternatively, these clients must have a registry change. For information about this registry change, see Microsoft Knowledge Base article 325465: Windows 2000 domain controllers require SP3 or later when using Windows Server 2003 administration tools. Also, some non-Microsoft operating systems do not support LDAP signing. If you enable this policy setting, client computers that use those operating systems may be unable to access domain resources.",

      "Description": "This policy setting determines what happens when the smart card for a logged-on user is removed from the smart card reader. The recommended state for this setting is: Lock Workstation. Configuring this setting to Force Logoff or Disconnect if a Remote Desktop Services session also conforms to the benchmark.",
      "Rationale": "Users sometimes forget to lock their workstations when they are away from them, allowing the possibility for malicious users to access their computers. If smart cards are used for authentication, the computer should automatically lock itself when the card is removed to ensure that only the user with the smart card is accessing resources using those credentials.",
      "Impact": "If you select Lock Workstation, the workstation is locked when the smart card is removed, allowing users to leave the area, take their smart card with them, and still maintain a protected session. If you select Force Logoff, users are automatically logged off when their smart card is removed. If you select Disconnect if a Remote Desktop Services session, removal of the smart card disconnects the session without logging the users off. This allows the user to insert the smart card and resume the session later, or at another smart card reader-equipped computer, without having to log on again. If the session is local, this policy will function identically to Lock Workstation. Enforcing this setting on computers used by people who must log onto multiple computers in order to perform their duties could be frustrating and lower productivity. For example, if network administrators are limited to a single account but need to log into several computers simultaneously in order to effectively manage the network enforcing this setting will limit them to logging onto one computer at a time. For these reasons it is recommended that this setting only be enforced on workstations used for purposes commonly associated with typical users such as document creation and email.",

      "Profile Applicability": "\uf0b7 Level 1 - Domain Controller \uf0b7 Level 1 - Member Server",
      "Description": "This policy setting determines whether the SMB server will negotiate SMB packet signing with clients that request it. If no signing request comes from the client, a connection will be allowed without a signature if the Microsoft network server: Digitally sign communications (always) setting is not enabled. Note: Enable this policy setting on SMB clients on your network to make them fully effective for packet signing with all clients and servers in your environment. The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.",
      "Rationale": "Session hijacking uses tools that allow attackers who have access to the same network as the client or server to interrupt, end, or steal a session in progress. Attackers can potentially intercept and modify unsigned SMB packets and then modify the traffic and forward it so that the server might perform undesirable actions. Alternatively, the attacker could pose as the server or client after legitimate authentication and gain unauthorized access to data. SMB is the resource sharing protocol that is supported by many Windows operating systems. It is the basis of NetBIOS and many other protocols. SMB signatures authenticate both users and the servers that host the data. If either side fails the authentication process, data transmission will not take place.",
      "Impact": "The Microsoft network server will negotiate SMB packet signing as requested by the client. That is, if packet signing has been enabled on the client, packet signing will be negotiated. The Windows 2000 Server, Windows 2000 Professional, Windows Server 2003, Windows XP Professional and Windows Vista implementations of the SMB file and print sharing protocol support mutual authentication, which prevents session hijacking attacks and supports message authentication to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. SMB signing provides this authentication by placing a digital signature into each SMB, which is then verified by both the client and the server. Implementation of SMB signing may negatively affect performance, because each packet needs to be signed and verified. If these settings are enabled on a server that is performing multiple roles, such as a small business server that is serving as a Domain Controller, file server, print server, and application server performance may be substantially slowed. Additionally, if you configure computers to ignore all unsigned SMB communications, older applications and operating systems will not be able to connect. However, if you completely disable all SMB signing, computers will be vulnerable to session hijacking attacks. When SMB signing policies are enabled on Domain Controllers running Windows Server 2003 and member computers running Windows Vista SP1 or Windows Server 2008 group policy processing will fail. A hotfix is available from Microsoft that resolves this issue; see Microsoft Knowledge Base article 950876 for more details: Group Policy settings are not applied on member computers that are running Windows Server 2008 or Windows Vista SP1 when certain SMB signing policies are enabled.",

      "Description": "This policy setting controls the level of validation a computer with shared folders or printers (the server) performs on the service principal name (SPN) that is provided by the client computer when it establishes a session using the server message block (SMB) protocol. The server message block (SMB) protocol provides the basis for file and print sharing and other networking operations, such as remote Windows administration. The SMB protocol supports validating the SMB server service principal name (SPN) within the authentication blob provided by a SMB client to prevent a class of attacks against SMB servers referred to as SMB relay attacks. This setting will affect both SMB1 and SMB2. The recommended state for this setting is: Accept if provided by client. Configuring this setting to Required from client also conforms to the benchmark. Note: Since the release of the MS KB3161561 security patch, this setting can cause significant issues (such as replication problems, group policy editing issues and blue screen crashes) on Domain Controllers when used simultaneously with UNC path hardening (i.e. Rule 18.5.14.1).

If the SPN does NOT match, the session request for that SMB client will be denied. If configured to Required from client, the SMB client MUST send a SPN name in session setup, and the SPN name provided MUST match the SMB server that is being requested to establish a connection. If no SPN is provided by client, or the SPN provided does not match, the session is denied.",

      "Description": "This setting determines if online identities are able to authenticate to this computer. The Public Key Cryptography Based User-to-User (PKU2U) protocol introduced in Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 is implemented as a security support provider (SSP). The SSP enables peer-to-peer authentication, particularly through the Windows 7 media and file sharing feature called HomeGroup, which permits sharing between computers that are not members of a domain. With PKU2U, a new extension was introduced to the Negotiate authentication package, Spnego.dll. In previous versions of Windows, Negotiate decided whether to use Kerberos or NTLM for authentication. The extension SSP for Negotiate, Negoexts.dll, which is treated as an authentication protocol by Windows, supports Microsoft SSPs including PKU2U. When computers are configured to accept authentication requests by using online IDs, Negoexts.dll calls the PKU2U SSP on the computer that is used to log on. The PKU2U SSP obtains a local certificate and exchanges the policy between the peer computers. When validated on the peer computer, the certificate within the metadata is sent to the logon peer for validation and associates the user's certificate to a security token and the logon process completes. The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.",

      "Method": "",
      "Profile Applicability": "\uf0b7 Level 1 - Domain Controller \uf0b7 Level 1 - Member Server",
      "Description": "LAN Manager (LM) was a family of early Microsoft client/server software (predating Windows NT) that allowed users to link personal computers together on a single network. LM network capabilities included transparent file and print sharing, user security features, and network administration tools. In Active Directory domains, the Kerberos protocol is the default authentication protocol. However, if the Kerberos protocol is not negotiated for some reason, Active Directory will use LM, NTLM, or NTLMv2. LAN Manager authentication includes the LM, NTLM, and NTLM version 2 (NTLMv2) variants, and is the protocol that is used to authenticate all Windows clients when they perform the following operations: \uf0b7 Join a domain \uf0b7 Authenticate between Active Directory forests \uf0b7 Authenticate to down-level domains \uf0b7 Authenticate to computers that do not run Windows 2000, Windows Server 2003, or Windows XP \uf0b7 Authenticate to computers that are not in the domain The Network security: LAN Manager authentication level setting determines which challenge/response authentication protocol is used for network logons. This choice affects the level of authentication protocol used by clients, the level of session security negotiated, and the level of authentication accepted by servers. The recommended state for this setting is: Send NTLMv2 response only. Refuse LM & NTLM.",
      "Rationale": "Windows 2000 and Windows XP clients were configured by default to send LM and NTLM authentication responses (Windows 95-based and Windows 98-based clients only send LM). The default settings in OSes predating Windows Vista / Windows Server 2008 (non- R2) allowed all clients to authenticate with servers and use their resources. However, this meant that LM responses - the weakest form of authentication response - were sent over the network, and it was potentially possible for attackers to sniff that traffic to more easily reproduce the user's password. The Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows NT operating systems cannot use the Kerberos version 5 protocol for authentication. For this reason, in a Windows Server 2003 domain, these computers authenticate by default with both the LM and NTLM protocols for network authentication. You can enforce a more secure authentication protocol for Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows NT by using NTLMv2. For the logon process, NTLMv2 uses a secure channel to protect the authentication process. Even if you use NTLMv2 for older clients and servers, Windows-based clients and servers that are members of the domain will use the Kerberos authentication protocol to authenticate with Windows Server 2003 or newer Domain Controllers. For these reasons, it is strongly preferred to restrict the use of LM & NTLM (non-v2) as much as possible.",
      "Impact": "Clients use NTLMv2 authentication only and use NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it; Domain Controllers refuse LM and NTLM (accept only NTLMv2 authentication). Clients that do not support NTLMv2 authentication will not be able to authenticate in the domain and access domain resources by using LM and NTLM.",

      "Rationale": "Unsigned network traffic is susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks in which an intruder captures the packets between the client and server, modifies them, and then forwards them to the server. For an LDAP server, this susceptibility means that an attacker could cause a server to make decisions that are based on false or altered data from the LDAP queries. To lower this risk in your network, you can implement strong physical security measures to protect the network infrastructure. Also, you can make all types of man-in-the-middle attacks extremely difficult if you require digital signatures on all network packets by means of IPsec authentication headers.",
      "Impact": "None - this is the default behavior. However, if you choose instead to configure the server to require LDAP signatures then you must also configure the client. If you do not configure the client it will not be able to communicate with the server, which could cause many features to fail, including user authentication, Group Policy, and logon scripts, because the caller will be told that the LDAP BIND command request failed.",

Note: In Server 2008 R2 and older versions, this setting had no impact on Remote Desktop (RDP) / Terminal Services sessions - it only affected the local console.

An enterprise that is running desktops as standard user may choose this setting to reduce help desk calls. Note: With this setting configured as recommended, the default error message displayed when a user attempts to perform an operation or run a program requiring privilege elevation (without Administrator rights) is \"This program will not run. This program is blocked by group policy. For more information, contact your system administrator.\" Some users who are not used to seeing this message may believe that the operation or program they attempted to run is specifically blocked by group policy, as that is what the message seems to imply. This message may therefore result in user questions as to why that specific operation/program is blocked, when in fact, the problem is that they need to perform the operation or run the program with an Administrative account (or \"Run as Administrator\" if it is already an Administrator account), and they are not doing that.",

Microsoft disagrees with this opinion, blocking outbound connections by default will force users to deal with a large number of dialog boxes prompting them to authorize or block applications such as their web browser or instant messaging software.

Verify that the packets sent from the remote computer are the same as those received by this computer. This error might also indicate interoperability problems with other IPsec implementations. \uf0b7 4961: IPsec dropped an inbound packet that failed a replay check. If this problem persists, it could indicate a replay attack against this computer. \uf0b7 4962: IPsec dropped an inbound packet that failed a replay check. The inbound packet had too low a sequence number to ensure it was not a replay. \uf0b7 4963: IPsec dropped an inbound clear text packet that should have been secured. This is usually due to the remote computer changing its IPsec policy without informing this computer. This could also be a spoofing attack attempt. \uf0b7 4965: IPsec received a packet from a remote computer with an incorrect Security Parameter Index (SPI). This is usually caused by malfunctioning hardware that is corrupting packets. If these errors persist, verify that the packets sent from the remote computer are the same as those received by this computer. This error may also indicate interoperability problems with other IPsec implementations. In that case, if connectivity is not impeded, then these events can be ignored. \uf0b7 5478: IPsec Services has started successfully. \uf0b7 5479: IPsec Services has been shut down successfully. The shutdown of IPsec Services can put the computer at greater risk of network attack or expose the computer to potential security risks. \uf0b7 5480: IPsec Services failed to get the complete list of network interfaces on the computer. This poses a potential security risk because some of the network interfaces may not get the protection provided by the applied IPsec filters. Use the IP Security Monitor snap-in to diagnose the problem. \uf0b7 5483: IPsec Services failed to initialize RPC server. IPsec Services could not be started. \uf0b7 5484: IPsec Services has experienced a critical failure and has been shut down. The shutdown of IPsec Services can put the computer at greater risk of network attack or expose the computer to potential security risks. \uf0b7 5485: IPsec Services failed to process some IPsec filters on a plug-and-play event for network interfaces.

      "Method": "",
      "Profile Applicability": "\uf0b7 Level 1 - Member Server",
      "Description": "In May 2015, Microsoft released the Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPS) tool, which is free and supported software that allows an organization to automatically set randomized and unique local Administrator account passwords on domain-attached workstations and Member Servers. The passwords are stored in a confidential attribute of the domain computer account and can be retrieved from Active Directory by approved Sysadmins when needed. The LAPS tool requires a small Active Directory Schema update in order to implement, as well as installation of a Group Policy Client Side Extension (CSE) on targeted computers. Please see the LAPS documentation for details. LAPS supports Windows Vista or newer workstation OSes, and Server 2003 or newer server OSes. LAPS does not support standalone computers - they must be joined to a domain. Note: Organizations that utilize 3rd-party commercial software to manage unique & complex local Administrator passwords on domain members may opt to disregard these LAPS recommendations. Note #2: LAPS is only designed to manage local Administrator passwords, and is therefore not recommended (or supported) for use directly on Domain Controllers, which do not have a traditional local Administrator account. We strongly encourage you to only deploy the LAPS CSE and LAPS GPO settings to member servers and workstations.",
      "Rationale": "Due to the difficulty in managing local Administrator passwords, many organizations choose to use the same password on all workstations and/or Member Servers when deploying them. This creates a serious attack surface security risk because if an attacker manages to compromise one system and learn the password to its local Administrator account, then they can leverage that account to instantly gain access to all other computers that also use that password for their local Administrator account.",
      "Impact": "No impact. When installed and registered properly, AdmPwd.dll takes no action unless given appropriate GPO commands during Group Policy refresh. It is not a memory-resident agent or service. In a disaster recovery scenario where Active Directory is not available, the local Administrator password will not be retrievable and a local password reset using a tool (such as Microsoft's Disaster and Recovery Toolset (DaRT) Recovery Image) may be necessary.",
      "Audit": "The LAPS AdmPwd GPO Extension / CSE can be verified to be installed by the presence of the following registry value: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Winlogon\\GPExtensions\\{D76B9641-3288-4f75-942D-087DE603E3EA}:DllName",

The passwords are stored in a confidential attribute of the domain computer account and can be retrieved from Active Directory by approved Sysadmins when needed. The LAPS tool requires a small Active Directory Schema update in order to implement, as well as installation of a Group Policy Client Side Extension (CSE) on targeted computers. Please see the LAPS documentation for details. LAPS supports Windows Vista or newer workstation OSes, and Server 2003 or newer server OSes. LAPS does not support standalone computers - they must be joined to a domain. The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled. Note: Organizations that utilize 3rd-party commercial software to manage unique & complex local Administrator passwords on domain members may opt to disregard these LAPS recommendations. Note #2: LAPS is only designed to manage local Administrator passwords, and is therefore not recommended (or supported) for use directly on Domain Controllers, which do not have a traditional local Administrator account. We strongly encourage you to only deploy the LAPS CSE and LAPS GPO settings to member servers and workstations.

The available methods are: \uf0b7 The B-node (broadcast) method only uses broadcasts. \uf0b7 The P-node (point-to-point) method only uses name queries to a name server (WINS). \uf0b7 The M-node (mixed) method broadcasts first, then queries a name server (WINS) if broadcast failed. \uf0b7 The H-node (hybrid) method queries a name server (WINS) first, then broadcasts if the query failed. The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: P-node (recommended) (point-to-point). Note: Resolution through LMHOSTS or DNS follows these methods.

The problem is that the 10 minute time-out period for the ICMP redirect-plumbed routes temporarily creates a network situation in which traffic will no longer be routed properly for the affected host. Ignoring such ICMP redirects will limit the system's exposure to attacks that will impact its ability to participate on the network.",
      "Impact": "When Routing and Remote Access Service (RRAS) is configured as an autonomous system boundary router (ASBR), it does not correctly import connected interface subnet routes. Instead, this router injects host routes into the OSPF routes. However, the OSPF router cannot be used as an ASBR router, and when connected interface subnet routes are imported into OSPF the result is confusing routing tables with strange routing paths.",

      "Rationale": "The NetBT protocol is designed not to use authentication, and is therefore vulnerable to spoofing. Spoofing makes a transmission appear to come from a user other than the user who performed the action. A malicious user could exploit the unauthenticated nature of the protocol to send a name-conflict datagram to a target computer, which would cause the computer to relinquish its name and not respond to queries. An attacker could send a request over the network and query a computer to release its NetBIOS name. As with any change that could affect applications, it is recommended that you test this change in a non-production environment before you change the production environment. The result of such an attack could be to cause intermittent connectivity issues on the target computer, or even to prevent the use of Network Neighborhood, domain logons, the NET SEND command, or additional NetBIOS name resolution.",

With LLMNR, queries are sent using multicast over a local network link on a single subnet from a client computer to another client computer on the same subnet that also has LLMNR enabled. LLMNR does not require a DNS server or DNS client configuration, and provides name resolution in scenarios in which conventional DNS name resolution is not possible. The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.",
      "Rationale": "An attacker can listen on a network for these LLMNR (UDP/5355) or NBT-NS (UDP/137) broadcasts and respond to them, tricking the host into thinking that it knows the location of the requested system. Note: To completely mitigate local name resolution poisoning, in addition to this setting, the properties of each installed NIC should also be set to Disable NetBIOS over TCP/IP (on the WINS tab in the NIC properties). Unfortunately, there is no global setting to achieve this that automatically applies to all NICs - it is a per-NIC setting that varies with different NIC hardware installations.",

      "Description": "This policy setting configures secure access to UNC paths. The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled, with \"Require Mutual Authentication\" and \"Require Integrity\" set for all NETLOGON and SYSVOL shares. Note: If the environment exclusively contains Windows 8.0 / Server 2012 (non-R2) or newer systems, then the \"Privacy\" setting may (optionally) also be set to enable SMB encryption. However, using SMB encryption will render the targeted share paths completely inaccessible by older OSes, so only use this additional option with caution and thorough testing.",
      "Rationale": "In February 2015, Microsoft released a new control mechanism to mitigate a security risk in Group Policy as part of the MS15-011 / MSKB 3000483 security update. This mechanism requires both the installation of the new security update and also the deployment of specific group policy settings to all computers on the domain from Windows Vista / Server 2008 (non-R2) or newer (the associated security patch to enable this feature was not released for Server 2003). A new group policy template (NetworkProvider.admx/adml) was also provided with the security update. Once the new GPO template is in place, the following are the minimum requirements to remediate the Group Policy security risk: \\\\*\\NETLOGON RequireMutualAuthentication=1, RequireIntegrity=1 \\\\*\\SYSVOL RequireMutualAuthentication=1, RequireIntegrity=1 Note: A reboot may be required after the setting is applied to a client machine to access the above paths. Additional guidance on the deployment of this security setting is available from the Microsoft Premier Field Engineering (PFE) Platforms TechNet Blog here: Guidance on Deployment of MS15-011 and MS15-014.",

IPv6 allows for many more IP addresses to be assigned than IPv4 did. Older networking, hosts and operating systems may not support IPv6 natively. The recommended state for this setting is: DisabledComponents - 0xff (255)",
      "Rationale": "Since the vast majority of private enterprise managed networks have no need to utilize IPv6 (because they have access to private IPv4 addressing), disabling IPv6 components removes a possible attack surface that is also harder to monitor the traffic on. As a result, we recommend configuring IPv6 to a Disabled state when it is not needed.",
      "Impact": "Connectivity to other systems using IPv6 will no longer operate, and software that depends on IPv6 will cease to function.

Many of these mitigations were later coded directly into Windows 10 and Server 2016. More information on EMET, including download and User Guide, can be obtained here: Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit - EMET - TechNet Security Note: Although EMET is quite effective at enhancing exploit protection on Windows server OSes prior to Server 2016, it is highly recommended that compatibility testing is done on typical server configurations (including all CIS-recommended EMET settings) before widespread deployment to your environment. Note #2: Microsoft has announced that EMET will be End-Of-Life (EOL) on July 31, 2018. This does not mean the software will stop working, only that Microsoft will not update it any further past that date, nor troubleshoot new problems with it. They are instead recommending that servers be upgraded to Server 2016. Note #3: EMET has been reported to be very problematic on 32-bit OSes - we only recommend using it with 64-bit OSes.",

To mitigate the risk of loss of recent data, you can configure the retention method so that older events are overwritten as needed. The consequence of this configuration is that older events will be removed from the logs. Attackers can take advantage of such a configuration, because they can generate a large number of extraneous events to overwrite any evidence of their attack. These risks can be somewhat reduced if you automate the archival and backup of event log data. Ideally, all specifically monitored events should be sent to a server that uses Microsoft System Center Operations Manager (SCOM) or some other automated monitoring tool. Such a configuration is particularly important because an attacker who successfully compromises a server could clear the Security log. If all events are sent to a monitoring server, then you will be able to gather forensic information about the attacker's activities.",

These risks can be somewhat reduced if you automate the archival and backup of event log data. Ideally, all specifically monitored events should be sent to a server that uses Microsoft System Center Operations Manager (SCOM) or some other automated monitoring tool.

Note: If your organization uses Office 365, be aware that this setting will prevent users from saving files to OneDrive/SkyDrive. Note #2: If your organization has decided to implement OneDrive for Business and therefore needs to except itself from this recommendation, we highly suggest that you also obtain and utilize the OneDrive.admx/adml template that is bundled with the latest OneDrive client, as noted at this link (this template is not included with the Windows Administrative Templates). Two alternative OneDrive settings in particular from that template are worth your consideration: \uf0b7 Allow syncing OneDrive accounts for only specific organizations - a computer-based setting that restricts OneDrive client connections to only approved tenant IDs. \uf0b7 Prevent users from synchronizing personal OneDrive accounts - a user-based setting that prevents use of consumer OneDrive (i.e. non-business).",

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: SSL. Note: In spite of this setting being labeled SSL, it is actually enforcing Transport Layer Security (TLS) version 1.0, not the older (and less secure) SSL protocol.",
      "Rationale": "The native Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) encryption is now considered a weak protocol, so enforcing the use of stronger Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption for all RDP communications between clients and RD Session Host servers is preferred.",
      "Impact": "TLS 1.0 will be required to authenticate to the RD Session Host server. If TLS is not supported, the connection fails. Note: By default, this setting will use a self-signed certificate for RDP connections. If your organization has established the use of a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) for SSL/TLS encryption, then we recommend that you also configure the Server authentication certificate template setting to instruct RDP to use a certificate from your PKI instead of a self-signed one. Note that the certificate template used for this purpose must have \u201cClient Authentication\u201d configured as an Intended Purpose. Note also that a valid, non-expired certificate using the specified template must already be installed on the server for it to work. Note #2: Some third party two-factor authentication solutions (e.g. RSA Authentication Agent) can be negatively affected by this setting, as the SSL/TLS security layer will expect the user's Windows password upon initial connection attempt (before the RDP logon screen), and once successfully authenticated, pass the credential along to that Windows session on the RDP host (to complete the login). If a two-factor agent is present and expecting a different credential at the RDP logon screen, this initial connection may result in a failed logon attempt, and also effectively cause a \u201cdouble logon\u201d requirement for each and every new RDP session.",

      "Description": "This policy setting allows you to configure a time limit for disconnected Remote Desktop Services sessions. The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: 1 minute.",
      "Rationale": "This setting helps to prevent active Remote Desktop sessions from tying up the computer for long periods of time while not in use, preventing computing resources from being consumed by large numbers of disconnected but still active sessions. In addition, old, forgotten Remote Desktop sessions that are still active can cause password lockouts if the user's password has changed but the old session is still running. For systems that limit the number of connected users (e.g. servers in the default Administrative mode - 2 sessions only), other users' old but still active sessions can prevent another user from connecting, resulting in an effective denial of service. This setting is important to ensure a disconnected session is properly terminated.",

The security features of Windows Installer normally prevent users from changing installation options that are typically reserved for system administrators, such as specifying the directory to which files are installed.

The opposite is true (and is consistent with the title of the setting). This is a wording mistake by Microsoft in the Administrative Template.",
      "Rationale": "Any feature is a potential avenue of attack, those that enable inbound network connections are particularly risky. Only enable the use of the Windows Remote Shell on trusted networks and when feasible employ additional controls such as IPsec.",
      "Impact": "New Remote Shell connections are not allowed and are rejected by the server. Note: On Server 2012 (non-R2) and newer, due to design changes in the OS after Server 2008 R2, configuring this setting as prescribed will prevent the ability to add or remove Roles and Features (even locally) via the GUI. We therefore recommend that the necessary Roles and Features be installed prior to configuring this setting on a Level 2 server. Alternatively, Roles and Features can still be added or removed using the PowerShell commands Add-WindowsFeature or Remove-WindowsFeature in the Server Manager module, even with this setting configured.",
